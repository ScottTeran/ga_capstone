              "'in the course of a single evening ildefonsa impala the most beautiful woman in the city marries again and again. her honeymoon with newly rich inventor freddy fixico is utterly kitschthe reticulated water of the famous falls was tinted gold the immediate rocks had been done by rambles and the hills had been contoured by spall. after a luxurious hour ildefonsa consults a trend indicator and realizes that freddys invention would soon be outmoded and his wealth gone so she immediately divorces him. whom shall i marry next ildefonsa asks herself on this slow tuesday night. meanwhile basil has been wheeling and dealing in the money market. he caused to collapse certain industrial empires that had grown up within the last two hours and made a good thing of recombining their wreckage. naturally enough his wife judy is chosen one of the ten bestdressed women during the froufrou fashion period about two oclock. in such a mayfly world plays and films run no longer than six minutes and stanley skuldugger can be voted the top actorimago of the middle hours of the night. having decided to produce a philosophical masterpiece maxwell mouser is willing to devote an entire seven minutes to the task. he turns to the ideas index sets the activator for the amount of wordage needed and for that extra bit of sparkle switches on a striking analogy blender calibrated to his particular personalitysignature. the resulting monograph quickly goes viralthis was truly one of the greatest works of philosophy to appear during the early and medium hours of the nightbut by dawn it will already be dismissed and forgotten. in slow tuesday night laffertypolitically conservative and devoutly catholicdepicts a society of meaningless flux and impermanence where there is no abiding city nor any sense of the spiritual. people surrender to the passing moment nothing seems to matter very much no hearts are permanently broken. yet all this meretricious shallowness is conveyed through a simple yet brilliant conceit if you speed up the world enough everything starts to resemble the frenetic climax of a keystone kops farce. in sevenday terror lafferty mentions an untidy suite that looked as though it belonged to a drunken sultan. thats a wonderful simile but also a fair description of his own gorgeous shambolic abundance. what we love about laffertys stories is the joyfulness of their telling the playful diction the topsyturvy plot surprises the knowing winks. to expect from them any logic but that of wonderland is to miss the party. after all as the rabelaisian hero of one at a time says if you insist on realism and perfect sense you put unnatural conditions on a tale. im pretty sure his creator would agree. a panhandler intercepted the young couple as they strolled down the night street. preserve us this night he said as he touched his hat to them and could you good people advance me a thousand dollars to be about the recouping of my fortunes i gave you a thousand last friday said the young man. indeed you did the panhandler replied and i paid you back tenfold by messenger before midnight. thats right george he did said the young woman. give it to him dear. i believe hes a good sort. so the young man gave the panhandler a thousand dollars and the panhandler touched his hat to them in thanks and went on to the recouping of his fortunes. as he went into money market the panhandler passed ildefonsa impala the most beautiful woman in the city. will you marry me this night ildy he asked cheerfully. oh i dont believe so basil she said. i marry you pretty often but tonight i dont seem to have any plans at all. you may make me a gift on your first or second however. i always like that. but when they had parted she asked herself but whom will i marry tonight the panhandler was basil bagelbaker who would be the richest man in the world within an hour and a half. he would make and lose four fortunes within eight hours and these not the little fortunes that ordinary men acquire slow tuesday night but titanic things. when the abebaios block had been removed from human minds people began to make decisions faster and often better. it had been the mental stutter. when it was understood what it was and that it had no useful function it was removed by simple childhood metasurgery. transportation and manufacturing had then become practically instantaneous. things that had once taken months and years now took only minutes and hours. a person could have one or several pretty intricate careers within an eighthour period. freddy fixico had just invented a manus module. freddy was a nyctalops and the modules were characteristic of these people. the people had then divided themselvesaccording to their natures and inclinationsinto the auroreans the hemerobians and the nyctalopsor the dawners who had their most active hours from four a.m. till noon the dayflies who obtained from noon to eight p.m.  and the nightseers whose civilization thrived from eight p.m. to four a.m. the cultures inventions markets and activities of these three folk were a little different. as a nyctalops freddy had just begun his working day at eight p.m. on a slow tuesday night. freddy rented an office and had it furnished. this took one minute negotiation selection and installation being almost instantaneous. then he invented the manus module that took another minute. he then had it manufactured and marketed in three minutes it was in the hands of key buyers. it caught on. it was an attractive module. the flow of orders began within thirty seconds. by ten minutes after eight every important person had one of the new manus modules and the trend had been set. the module began to sell in the millions. it was one of the most interesting fads of the night or at least the early part of the night. manus modules had no practical function no more than had sameki verses. they were attractive of a psychologically satisfying size and shape and could be held in the hands set on a table or installed in a module niche of any wall. naturally freddy became very rich. ildefonsa impala the most beautiful woman in the city was always interested in newly rich men. she came to see freddy about eightthirty. people made up their minds fast and ildefonsa had hers made up when she came. freddy made his own up quickly and divorced judy fixico in small claims court. freddy and ildefonsa went honeymooning to paraiso dorado a resort. it was wonderful. all of ildys marriages were. there was the wonderful floodlighted scenery. the recirculated water of the famous falls was tinted gold the immediate rocks had been done by rambles and the hills had been contoured by spall. the beach was a perfect copy of that at merevale and the popular drink that first part of the night was blue absinthe. but scenerywhether seen for the first time or revisited after an interval is stirring for the sudden intense view of it. it is not meant to be lingered over. food selected and prepared instantly is eaten with swift enjoyment and blue absinthe lasts no longer than its own novelty. loving for ildefonsa and her paramours was quick and consuming and repetition would have been pointless to her. besides ildefonsa and freddy had taken only the one hour luxury honeymoon. freddy wished to continue the relationship but ildefonsa glanced at a trend indicator. the manus module would hold its popularity for only the first third of the night. already it had been discarded by people who mattered. and freddy fixico was not one of the regular successes. he enjoyed a full career only about one night a week. they were back in the city and divorced in small claims court by nine thirtyfive. the stock of manus modules was remaindered and the last of it would be disposed to bargain hunters among the dawners who will buy anything. whom shall i marry next ildefonsa asked herself. it looks like a slow night. bagelbaker is buying ran the word through money market but bagelbaker was selling again before the word had made its rounds. basil bagelbaker enjoyed making money and it was a pleasure to watch him work as he dominated the floor of the market and assembled runners and a competent staff out of the corner of his mouth. helpers stripped the panhandler rags off him and wrapped him in a tycoon toga. he sent one runner to pay back twentyfold the young couple who had advanced him a thousand dollars. he sent another with a more substantial gift to ildefonsa impala for basil cherished their relationship. basil acquired title to the trend indication complex and had certain falsifications set into it. he caused to collapse certain industrial empires that had grown up within the last two hours and made a good thing of recombining their wreckage. he had been the richest man in the world for some minutes now. he became so money heavy that he could not maneuver with the agility he had shown an hour before. he became a great fat buck and the pack of expert wolves circled him to bring him down. very soon he would lose that first fortune of the evening. the secret of basil bagelbaker is that he enjoyed losing money spectacularly after he was full of it to the bursting point. a thoughtful man named maxwell mouser had just produced a work of actinic philosophy. it took him seven minutes to write it. to write works of philosophy one used the flexible outlines and the idea indexes one set the activator for such a wordage in each subsection an adept would use the paradox feedin and the strikinganalogy blender one calibrated the particularslant and the personalitysignature. it had to come out a good work for excellence had become the automatic minimum for such productions. i will scatter a few nuts on the frosting said maxwell and he pushed the lever for that. this sifted handfuls of words like chthonic and heuristic and prozymeides through the thing so that nobody could doubt it was a work of philosophy. maxwell mouser sent the work out to publishers and received it back each time in about three minutes. an analysis of it and reason for rejection was always givenmostly that the thing had been done before and better. maxwell received it back ten times in thirty minutes and was discouraged. then there was a break. ladions work had become a hit within the last ten minutes and it was now recognized that mousers monograph was both an answer and a supplement to it. it was accepted and published in less than a minute after this break. the reviews of the first five minutes were cautious ones then real enthusiasm was shown. this was truly one of the greatest works of philosophy to appear during the early and medium hours of the night. there were those who said it might be one of the enduring works and even have a holdover appeal to the dawners the next morning. naturally maxwell became very rich and naturally ildefonsa came to see him about midnight. being a revolutionary philosopher maxwell thought that he might make some free arrangement but ildefonsa insisted it must be marriage. so maxwell divorced judy mouser in small claims court and went off with ildefonsa. this judy herself though not so beautiful as ildefonsa was the fastest taker in the city. she only wanted the men of the moment for a moment and she was always there before even ildefonsa. ildefonsa believed that she took the men away from judy judy said that ildy had her leavings and nothing else. i had him first judy would always mock as she raced through small claims court. oh that damned urchin ildefonsa would moan. she wears my very hair before i do. maxwell mouser and ildefonsa impala went honeymooning to musicbox mountain a resort. it was wonderful. the peaks were done with green snow by dunbar and fittle. back at money market basil bagelbaker was putting together his third and greatest fortune of the night which might surpass in magnitude even his fourth fortune of the thursday before. the chalets were switzier than the real swiss and had live goats in every room. and stanley skuldugger was emerging as the top actorimago of the middle hours of the night. the popular drink for that middle part of the night was glotzenglubber eve cheese and rhine wine over pink ice. and back in the city the leading nyctalops were taking their midnight break at the toppers club. of course it was wonderful as were all of ildefonsasbut she had never been really up on philosophy so she had scheduled only the special thirty fiveminute honeymoon. she looked at the trend indicator to be sure. she found that her current husband had been obsoleted and his opus was now referred to sneeringly as mousers mouse. they went back to the city and were divorced in small claims court. the membership of the toppers club varied. success was the requisite of membership. basil bagelbaker might be accepted as a member elevated to the presidency and expelled from it as a dirty pauper from three to six times a night. but only important persons could belong to it or those enjoying brief moments of importance. i believe i will sleep during the dawner period in the morning overcall said. i may go up to this new place koimopolis for an hour of it. theyre said to be good. where will you sleep basil flop house. i believe i will sleep an hour by the midian method said burnbanner. they have a fine new clinic. and perhaps ill sleep an hour by the prasenka process and an hour by the dormidio. crackle has been sleeping an hour every period by the natural method said overcall. i did that for half an hour not long since said burnbanner. i believe an hour is too long to give it. have you tried the natural method basil always. natural method and a bottle of redeye. stanley skuldugger had become the most meteoric actorimago for a week. naturally he became very rich and ildefonsa impala went to see him about three a.m. i had him first rang the mocking voice of judy skuldugger as she skipped through her divorce in small claims court. and ildefonsa and stanleyboy went off honeymooning. it is always fun to finish up a period with an actorimago who is the hottest property in the business. there is something so adolescent and boorish about them. besides there was the publicity and ildefonsa liked that. the rumormills ground. would it last ten minutes thirty an hour would it be one of those rare nyctalops marriages that lasted through the rest of the night and into the daylight offhours would it even last into the next night as some had been known to do actually it lasted nearly forty minutes which was almost to the end of the period. it had been a slow tuesday night. a few hundred new products had run their course on the market. there had been a score of dramatic hits three minute and fiveminute capsule dramas and several of the sixminute long play affairs. night street ninea solidly sordid offeringseemed to be in as the drama of the night unless there should be a late hit. hundredstoried buildings had been erected occupied obsoleted and demolished again to make room for more contemporary structures. only the mediocre would use a building that had been left over from the day fliers or the dawners or even the nyctalops of the night before. the city was rebuilt pretty completely at least three times during an eighthour period. the period drew near its end. basil bagelbaker the richest man in the world the reigning president of the toppers club was enjoying himself with his cronies. his fourth fortune of the night was a paper pyramid that had risen to incredible heights but basil laughed to himself as he savored the manipulation it was founded on. three ushers of the toppers club came in with firm step. get out of here you dirty bum they told basil savagely. they tore the tycoons toga off him and then tossed him his seedy panhandlers rags with a threeman sneer. all gone basil asked. i gave it another five minutes. all gone said a messenger from money market. nine billion gone in five minutes and it really pulled some others down with it. pitch the busted bum out howled overcall and burnbanner and the other cronies. wait basil said overcall. turn in the presidents crosier before we kick you downstairs. after all youll have it several times again tomorrow night. the period was over. the nyctalops drifted off to sleep clinics or leisure hour hideouts to pass their ebb time. the auroreans the dawners took over the vital stuff. now you would see some action those dawners really made fast decisions. you wouldnt catch them wasting a full minute setting up a business. a sleepy panhandler met ildefonsa impala on the way. preserve us this morning ildy he said and will you marry in the coming night likely i will basil she told him. did you marry judy during the night past im not sure. could you let me have two dollars ildy out of the question. i believe a judy bagelbaker was named one of the ten bestdressed women during the froufrou fashion period about two oclock. why do you need two dollars a dollar for a bed and a dollar for redeye. after all i sent you two million out of my second. i keep my two sorts of accounts separate. heres a dollar basil. now be off i cant be seen talking to a dirty panhandler. thank you ildy. ill get the redeye and sleep in an alley. preserve us this morning. bagelbaker shuffled off whistling slow tuesday night. and already the dawners had set wednesday morning to jumping. narrow valley is possibly ray laffertys single most approachable and humane tale. it fairly bulges with people youd like to have for neighbors clarence littlesaddle and his father clarence bigsaddle of course but also the beefy man with the land office in his desk the farmer tom dublin who enjoys firing his rifle at friends for a joke the inexplicably ubiquitous willy mcgilly and not one but two smartmouthed little girls. their brothers are ok too but lafferty had a particular gift for precocious little girls. admittedly robert rampart père is a blowhard but one out of a family of seven isnt bad. ive lost track of how many people ive converted to lafferty fans by thrusting forward a copy of nine hundred grandmothers with a thumb bookmarking narrow valley and saying hereread this its easy to like. this is one of the stories responsible for the notion that lafferty was principally influenced by american tall tales. its true that he accomplished a great deal of his effects using deadpan narration of wondrous events. also that he pretty much ignored the internal psychology of his characters. henry james he wasnt. if a mans possessions were taken away from him lafferty had him throw back his head and lament this fact in words. if a woman lost interest in an enterprise he indicated it by having her say exactly that. so yes the assertion is in part valid. but a lot of people have written modernday tall tales and not one of them has come close to writing like the bard of tulsa. consider such digressions as clarence littlesaddles riff on the significance of the war bonnet and the lecture on how much larger the moon appears at the horizon than overhead. introduction by michael swanwick narrow valley consider his beautiful use of dialect. consider his lovely comic asides and delightful parodies of scientific argot. tall tales are nothing if not straightforward. narrow valley is anything but. this is a sophisticated work written by a sophisticated man. you can tell a lot about a writer by what he chooses to celebrate. there is a grim backstory underlying this tale and lafferty who knew oklahoma history inside and out was well aware of it. in the early seventeenth century there were sixty thousand pawnee in possession of a great deal of land and by 1875 … well you can read that for yourself in the opening sentence. but narrow valley is almost paradoxically one of laffertys sunniest works a comedy and a paean to resilience and human decency. its also as i said easy to like. youll see. in the year 1893 land allotments in severalty were made to the remaining eight hundred and twentyone pawnee indians. each would receive one hundred and sixty acres of land and no more and thereafter the pawnees would be expected to pay taxes on their land the same as the whiteeyes did. kitkehahke clarence bigsaddle cussed. you cant kick a dog around proper on a hundred and sixty acres. and i sure am not hear before about this pay taxes on land. clarence bigsaddle selected a nice green valley for his allotment. it was one of the half dozen plots he had always regarded as his own. he sodded around the summer lodge that he had there and made it an allseason home. but he sure didnt intend to pay taxes on it. so he burned leaves and bark and made a speech that my valley be always wide and flourish and green and such stuff as that he orated in pawnee chant style. but that it be narrow if an intruder come. he didnt have any balsam bark to burn. he threw on a little cedar bark instead. he didnt have any elder leaves. he used a handful of jackoak leaves. and he forgot the word. how you going to work it if you forget the word petahauerat he howled out with the confidence he hoped would fool the fates. thats the same long of a word he said in a low aside to himself. but he was doubtful. what am i a white man a burrtailed jack a new kind of nut to think it will work he asked. i have to laugh at me. oh well we see. narrow valley he threw the rest of the bark and the leaves on the fire and he hollered the wrong word out again. and he was answered by a dazzling sheet of summer lightning. skidi clarence bigsaddle swore. it worked. i didnt think it would. clarence bigsaddle lived on his land for many years and he paid no taxes. intruders were unable to come down to his place. the land was sold for taxes three times but nobody ever came down to claim it. finally it was carried as open land on the books. homesteaders filed on it several times but none of them fulfilled the qualification of living on the land. half a century went by. clarence bigsaddle called his son. ive had it boy he said. i think ill just go in the house and die. ok dad the son clarence littlesaddle said. im going in to town to shoot a few games of pool with the boys. ill bury you when i get back this evening. so the son clarence littlesaddle inherited. he also lived on the land for many years without paying taxes. there was a disturbance in the courthouse one day. the place seemed to be invaded in force but actually there were but one man one woman and five children. im robert rampart said the man and we want the land office. im robert rampart junior said a nineyearold gangler and we want it pretty blamed quick. i dont think we have anything like that the girl at the desk said. isnt that something they had a long time ago ignorance is no excuse for inefficiency my dear said mary mabel rampart an eightyearold who could easily pass for eight and a half. after i make my report i wonder who will be sitting at your desk tomorrow. you people are either in the wrong state or the wrong century the girl said. the homestead act still obtains robert rampart insisted. there is one tract of land carried as open in this county. i want to file on it. cecilia rampart answered the knowing wink of a beefy man at the distant desk. hi she breathed as she slinked over. im cecilia rampart but my stage name is cecilia san juan. do you think that seven is too young to play ingénue roles not for you the man said. tell your folks to come over here. do you know where the land office is cecilia asked. sure. its the fourth lefthand drawer of my desk. the smallest office we got in the whole courthouse. we dont use it much any more. the ramparts gathered around. the beefy man started to make out the papers. this is the land description robert rampart began. why youve got it down already. how did you know ive been around here a long time the man answered. they did the paperwork and robert rampart filed on the land. you wont be able to come onto the land itself though the man said. why wont i rampart demanded. isnt the description accurate oh i suppose so. but nobodys ever been able get to the land. its become a sort of joke. well i intend to get to the bottom of that joke rampart insisted. i will occupy the land or i will find out why not. im not sure about that the beefy man said. the last man to file on the land about a dozen years ago wasnt able to occupy the land. and he wasnt able to say why he couldnt. its kind of interesting the look on their faces after they try it for a day or two and then give it up. the ramparts left the courthouse loaded into their camper and drove out to find their land. they stopped it at the house of a cattle and wheat farmer named charley dublin. dublin met them with a grin which indicated he had been tipped off. come along if you want to folks dublin said. the easiest way is on foot across my short pasture here. your lands directly west of mine. they walked the short distance to the border. my name is tom rampart mr. dublin. sixyearold tom made conversation as they walked. but my name is really ramires and not tom. i am the issue of an indiscretion of my mother in mexico several years ago. the boy is a kidder mr. dublin said the mother nina rampart defending herself. i have never been in mexico but sometimes i have the urge to disappear there forever. ah yes mrs. rampart. and what is the name of the youngest boy here charley dublin asked. fatty said fatty rampart. but surely that is not your given name audifax said fiveyearold fatty. ah well audifax fatty are you a kidder too hes getting better at it mr. dublin mary mabel said. he was a twin till last week. his twin was named skinny. mama left skinny unguarded while she was out tippling and there were wild dogs in the neighborhood. when mama got back do you know what was left of skinny two neck bones and an ankle bone. that was all. poor skinny dublin said. well rampart this is the fence and the end of my land. yours is just beyond. is that ditch on my land rampart asked. that ditch is your land. ill have it filled in. its a dangerous deep cut even if it is narrow. and the other fence looks like a good one and i sure have a pretty plot of land beyond it. no rampart the land beyond the second fence belongs to holister hyde charley dublin said. that second fence is the end of your land. now just wait a minute dublin theres something wrong here. my land is one hundred and sixty acres which would be a half mile on a side. wheres my halfmile width between the two fences. thats not eight feet. doesnt look like it does it rampart tell you whattheres plenty of throwingsized rocks around. try to throw one across it. im not interested in any such boys games rampart exploded. i want my land. but the rampart children were interested in such games. they got with it with those throwing rocks. they winged them out over the little gully. the stones acted funny. they hung in the air as it were and diminished in size. and they were small as pebbles when they dropped down down into the gully. none of them could throw a stone across that ditch and they were throwing kids. you and your neighbor have conspired to fence open land for your own use rampart charged. no such thing rampart dublin said cheerfully. my land checks perfectly. so does hydes. so does yours if we knew how to check it. its like one of those trick topological drawings. it really is half a mile from here to there but the eye gets lost somewhere. its your land. crawl through the fence and figure it out. rampart crawled through the fence and drew himself up to jump the gully. then he hesitated. he got a glimpse of just how deep that gully was. still it wasnt five feet across. there was a heavy fence post on the ground designed for use as a corner post. rampart upended it with some effort. then he shoved it to fall and bridge the gully. but it fell short and it shouldnt have. an eightfoot post should bridge a fivefoot gully. the post fell into the gully and rolled and rolled and rolled. it spun as though it were rolling outward but it made no progress except vertically. the post came to rest on a ledge of the gully so close that rampart could almost reach out and touch it but it now appeared no bigger than a match stick. there is something wrong with that fence post or with the world or with my eyes robert rampart said. i wish i felt dizzy so i could blame it on that. theres a little game that i sometimes play with my neighbor hyde when were both out dublin said. ive a heavy rifle and i train it on the middle of his forehead as he stands on the other side of the ditch apparently eight feet away. i fire it off then im a good shot and i hear it whine across. itd kill him dead if things were as they seem. but hydes in no danger. the shot always bangs into that little scuff of rocks and boulders about thirty feet below him. i can see it kick up the rock dust there and the sound of it rattling into those little boulders comes back to me in about two and a half seconds. a bullbat poor people call it the nighthawk raveled around in the air and zoomed out over the narrow ditch but it did not reach the other side. the bird dropped below ground level and could be seen against the background of the other side of the ditch. it grew smaller and hazier as though at a distance of three or four hundred yards. the white bars on its wings could no longer be discerned then the bird itself could hardly be discerned but it was far short of the other side of the fivefoot ditch. a man identified by charley dublin as the neighbor hollister hyde had appeared on the other side of the little ditch. hyde grinned and waved. he shouted something but could not be heard. hyde and i both read mouths dublin said so we can talk across the ditch easy enough. which kid wants to play chicken hyde will barrel a goodsized rock right at your head and if you duck or flinch youre chicken. me me audifax rampart challenged. and hyde a big man with big hands did barrel a fearsome jagged rock right at the head of the boy. it would have killed him if things had been as they appeared. but the rock diminished to nothing and disappeared into the ditch. here was a phenomenon things seemed realsized on either side of the ditch but they diminished coming out over the ditch either way. everybody game for it robert rampart junior asked. we wont get down there by standing here mary mabel said. nothing wenchered nothing gained said cecilia. i got that from an ad for a sex comedy. then the five rampart kids ran down into the gully. ran down is right. it was almost as if they ran down the vertical face of a cliff. they couldnt do that. the gully was no wider than the stride of the biggest kids. but the gully diminished those children it ate them alive. they were dollsized. they were acornsized. they were running for minute after minute across a ditch that was only five feet across. they were going deeper in it and getting smaller. robert rampart was roaring his alarm and his wife nina was screaming. then she stopped. what am i carrying on so loud about she asked herself. it looks like fun. ill do it too. she plunged into the gully diminished in size as the children had done and ran at a pace to carry her a hundred yards away across a gully only five feet wide. that robert rampart stirred things up for a while then. he got the sheriff there and the highway patrolmen. a ditch had stolen his wife and five children he said and maybe had killed them. and if anybody laughs there may be another killing. he got the colonel of the state national guard there and a command post set up. he got a couple of airplane pilots. robert rampart had one quality when he hollered people came. he got the newsmen out from ttown and the eminent scientists dr. velikof vonk arpad arkabaranan and willy mcgilly. that bunch turns up every time you get on a good one. they just happen to be in that part of the country where something interesting is going on. they attacked the thing from all four sides and the top and by inner and outer theory. if a thing measures half a mile on each side and the sides are straight there just has to be something in the middle of it. they took pictures from the air and they turned out perfect. they proved that robert rampart had the prettiest hundred and sixty acres in the country the larger part of it being a lush green valley and all of it being half a mile on a side and situated just where it should be. they took groundlevel photos then and it showed a beautiful halfmile stretch of land between the boundaries of charley dublin and hollister hyde. but a man isnt a camera. none of them could see that beautiful spread with the eyes in their heads. where was it down in the valley itself everything was normal. it really was half a mile wide and no more than eighty feet deep with a very gentle slope. it was warm and sweet and beautiful with grass and grain. nina and the kids loved it and they rushed to see what squatter had built that little house on their land. a house or a shack. it had never known paint but paint would have spoiled it. it was built of split timbers dressed near smooth with axe and draw knife chinked with white clay and sodded up to about half its height. and there was an interloper standing by the little lodge. here here what are you doing on our land robert rampart junior demanded of the man. now you just shamble off again wherever you came from. ill bet youre a thief too and those cattle are stolen. only the blackandwhite calf clarence littlesaddle said. i couldnt resist him but the rest are mine. i guess ill just stay around and see that you folks get settled all right. is there any wild indians around here fatty rampart asked. no not really. i go on a bender about every three months and get a little bit wild and theres a couple osage boys from gray horse that get noisy sometimes but thats about all clarence littlesaddle said. you certainly dont intend to palm yourself off on us as an indian mary mabel challenged. youll find us a little too knowledgeable for that. little girl you might as well tell this cow theres no room for her to be a cow since youre so knowledgeable. she thinks shes a shorthorn cow named sweet virginia i think im a pawnee indian named clarence. break it to us real gentle if were not. if youre an indian wheres your war bonnet theres not a feather on you anywhere. how you be sure theres a story that we got feathers instead of hair on aw i cant tell a joke like that to a little girl how come youre not wearing the iron crown of lombardy if youre a white girl how you expect me to believe youre a little white girl and your folks came from europe a couple hundred years ago if you dont wear it there are six hundred tribes and only one of them the oglala sioux had the war bonnet and only the big leaders never more than two or three of them alive at one time wore it. your analogy is a little strained mary mabel said. those indians we saw in florida and the ones at atlantic city had war bonnets and they couldnt very well have been the kind of sioux you said. and just last night on the tv in the motel those massachusetts indians put a war bonnet on the president and called him the great white father. you mean to tell me that they were all phonies hey whos laughing at who here if youre an indian wheres your bow and arrow tom rampart interrupted. i bet you cant even shoot one. youre sure right there clarence admitted. i never shot one of those things but once in my life. they used to have an archery range in boulder park over in ttown and you could rent the things and shoot at targets tied to hay bales. hey i barked my whole forearm and nearly broke my thumb when the bowstring thwacked home. i couldnt shoot that thing at all. i dont see how anybody ever could shoot one of them. ok kids nina rampart called to her brood. lets start pitching this junk out of the shack so we can move in. is there any way we can drive our camper down here clarence sure theres a pretty good dirt road and its a lot wider than it looks from the top. i got a bunch of green bills in an old night charley in the shack. let me get them and then ill clear out for a while. the shack hasnt been cleaned out for seven years since the last time this happened. ill show you the road to the top and you can bring your car down it. hey you old indian you lied cecilia rampart shrilled from the doorway of the shack. you do have a war bonnet. can i have it i didnt mean to lie i forgot about that thing clarence littlesaddle said. my son clarence bareback sent that to me from japan for a joke a long time ago. sure you can have it. all the children were assigned tasks carrying the junk out of the shack and setting fire to it. nina rampart and clarence littlesaddle ambled up to the rim of the valley by the vehicle road that was wider than it looked from the top. nina youre back i thought you were gone forever robert rampart jittered at seeing her again. whatwhere are the children why i left them down in the valley robert. that is ah down in that little ditch right there. now youve got me worried again. im going to drive the camper down there and unload it. youd better go on down and lend a hand too robert and quit talking to all these funnylooking men here. and nina went back to dublins place for the camper. it would be easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for that intrepid woman to drive a car down into that narrow ditch the eminent scientist dr. velikof vonk said. you know how that camel does it clarence littlesaddle offered appearing of a sudden from nowhere. he just closes one of his own eyes and flops back his ears and plunges right through. a camel is mighty narrow when he closes one eye and flops back his ears. besides they use a bigeyed needle in the act. whered this crazy man come from robert rampart demanded jumping three feet in the air. things are coming out of the ground now. i want my land i want my children i want my wife whoops here she comes driving it. nina you cant drive a loaded camper into a little ditch like that youll be killed or collapsed nina rampart drove the loaded camper into the little ditch at a pretty good rate of speed. the best of belief is that she just closed one eye and plunged right through. the car diminished and dropped and it was smaller than a toy car. but it raised a pretty good cloud of dust as it bumped for several hundred yards across a ditch that was only five feet wide. rampart its akin to the phenomenon known as looming only in reverse the eminent scientist arpad arkabaranan explained as he attempted to throw a rock across the narrow ditch. the rock rose very high in the air seemed to hang at its apex while it diminished to the size of a grain of sand and then fell into the ditch not six inches of the way across. there isnt anybody going to throw across a halfmile valley even if it looks five feet. look at a rising moon sometimes rampart. it appears very large as though covering a great sector of the horizon but it only covers onehalf of a degree. it is hard to believe that you could set seven hundred and twenty of such large moons side by side around the horizon or that it would take one hundred and eighty of the big things to reach from the horizon to a point overhead. it is also hard to believe that your valley is twelve hundred times as wide as it appears but it has been surveyed and it is. i want my land. i want my children. i want my wife robert chanted dully. damn i let her get away again. i tell you rampy clarence littlesaddle squared on him a man that lets his wife get away twice doesnt deserve to keep her. i give you till nightfall then you forfeit. ive taken a liking to the brood. one of us is going to be down there tonight. after a while a bunch of them were off in that little tavern on the road between cleveland and osage. it was only half a mile away. if the valley had run in the other direction it would have been only six feet away. it is a psychic nexus in the form of an elongated dome said the eminent scientist dr. velikof vonk. it is maintained subconsciously by the concatenation of at least two minds the stronger of them belonging to a man dead for many years. it has apparently existed for a little less than a hundred years and in another hundred years it will be considerably weakened. we know from our checking out folk tales of europe as well as cambodia that these ensorcelled areas seldom survive for more than two hundred and fifty years. the person who first set such a thing in being will usually lose interest in it and in all worldly things within a hundred years of his own death. this is a simple thanatopsychic limitation. as a shortterm device the thing has been used several times as a military tactic. this psychic nexus as long as it maintains itself causes group illusion but it is really a simple thing. it doesnt fool birds or rabbits or cattle or cameras only humans. there is nothing meteorological about it. it is strictly psychological. im glad i was able to give a scientific explanation to it or it would have worried me. it is continental fault coinciding with a noospheric fault said the eminent scientist arpad arkabaranan. the valley really is half a mile wide and at the same time it really is only five feet wide. if we measured correctly we would get these dual measurements. of course it is meteorological everything including dreams is meteorological. it is the animals and cameras which are fooled as lacking a true dimension it is only humans who see the true duality. the phenomenon should be common along the whole continental fault where the earth gains or loses half a mile that has to go somewhere. likely it extends through the whole sweep of the cross timbers. many of those trees appear twice and many do not appear at all. a man in the proper state of mind could farm that land or raise cattle on it but it doesnt really exist. there is a clear parallel in the luftspiegelungthal sector in the black forest of germany which exists or does not exist according to the circumstances and to the attitude of the beholder. then we have the case of mad mountain in morgan county tennessee which isnt there all the time and also the little lobo mirage south of presidio texas from which twenty thousand barrels of water were pumped in one twoandahalfyear period before the mirage reverted to mirage status. im glad i was able to give a scientific explanation to this or it would have worried me. i just dont understand how he worked it said the eminent scientist willy mcgilly. cedar bark jackoak leaves and the world petahauerat. the things impossible when i was a boy and we wanted to make a hideout we used bark from the skunkspruce tree the leaves of a boxelder and the word was boadicea. all three elements are wrong here. i cannot find a scientific explanation for it and it does worry me. they went back to narrow valley. robert rampart was still chanting dully i want my land. i want my children. i want my wife. nina rampart came chugging up out of the narrow ditch in the camper and emerged through that little gate a few yards down the fence row. suppers ready and were tired of waiting for you robert she said. a fine homesteader you are afraid to come onto your own land come along now im tired of waiting for you. i want my land i want my children i want my wife robert rampart still chanted. oh there you are nina. you stay here this time. i want my land i want my children i want an answer to this terrible thing. it is time we decided who wears the pants in this family nina said stoutly. she picked up her husband slung him over her shoulder carried him to the camper and dumped him in slammed as it seemed a dozen doors at once and drove furiously down into the narrow valley which already seemed wider. why that place was getting normaler and normaler by the minute pretty soon it looked almost as wide as it was supposed to be. the psychic nexus in the form of an elongated dome had collapsed. the continental fault that coincided with the noospheric fault had faced facts and decided to conform. the ramparts were in effective possession of their homestead and narrow valley was as normal as any place anywhere. i have lost my land clarence littlesaddle moaned. it was the land of my father clarence bigsaddle and i meant it to be the land of my son clarence bareback. it looked so narrow that people did not notice how wide it was and people did not try to enter it. now i have lost it. clarence littlesaddle and the eminent scientist willy mcgilly were standing on the edge of narrow valley which now appeared its true half mile extent. the moon was just rising so big that it filled a third of the sky. who would have imagined that it would take a hundred and eighty of such monstrous things to reach from the horizon to a point overhead and yet you could sight it with sighters and figure it so. i had a little bearcat by the tail and i let go clarence groaned. i had a fine valley for free and i have lost it. i am like that hardluck guy in the funnypaper or job in the bible. destitution is my lot. willy mcgilly looked around furtively. they were alone on the edge of the halfmilewide valley. lets give it a booster shot willy mcgilly said. hey those two got with it they started a snapping fire and began to throw the stuff onto it. bark from the dogelm treehow do you know it wont work it was working already the other side of the valley seemed a hundred yards closer and there were alarmed noises coming up from the people in the valley. leaves from a black locust treeand the valley narrowed still more there was moreover terrified screaming of both children and big people from the depths of narrow valley and the happy voice of mary mabel rampart chanting earthquake earthquake that my valley be always wide and flourish and such stuff and green with money and grass clarence littlesaddle orated in pawnee chant style but that it be narrow if intruders come smash them like bugs people that valley wasnt over a hundred feet wide now and the screaming of the people in the bottom of the valley had been joined by the hysterical coughing of the camper car starting up. willy and clarence threw everything that was left on the fire. but the word the word who remembers the word corsicanatexas clarence littlesaddle howled out with confidence he hoped would fool the fates. he was answered not only by a dazzling sheet of summer lightning but also by thunder and raindrops. chahiksi clarence littlesaddle swore. it worked. i didnt think it would. it will be all right now. i can use the rain. the valley was again a ditch only five feet wide. the camper car struggled out of narrow valley through the little gate. it was smashed flat as a sheet of paper and the screaming kids and people in it had only one dimension. its closing in its closing in robert rampart roared and he was no thicker than if he had been made out of cardboard. were smashed like bugs the rampart boys intoned. were thin like paper. mort ruine ecrasement spokeacted cecilia rampart like the great tragedienne she was. help help nina rampart croaked but she winked at willy and clarence as they rolled by. this homesteading jag always did leave me a little flat. dont throw those paper dolls away. they might be the ramparts mary mabel called. the camper car coughed again and bumped along on level ground. this couldnt last forever. the car was widening out as it bumped along. did we overdo it clarence willy mcgilly asked. what did one flat lander say to the other dimension of us never got around clarence said. no i dont think we overdid it willy. that car must be eighteen inches wide already and they all ought to be normal by the time they reach the main road. the next time i do it i think ill throw woodgrain plastic on the fire to see whos kidding who. lafferty strikes the reader as sui generis a literary creator like no other. but he also comes across as uniquely himself a writer so potently fizzy and tipsy making that one could say his prose laffervesces. see the first paragraph of nor limestone islands a tale arising from laffertys interest in geology mineralogy rockhounding storymining and architectural and literary lapidaries. disarmingly he had the ability to appear to be an expert in every ology imaginable. that paragraph reads a lapidary is one who cuts polishes engraves and sets small stones. he is also a scrivener who sets in little stones or pieces here and there and attempts to make a mosaic out of them. with that dubious hook our oklahoman leprechaun not only defines a term that may not feel wholly familiar but also compares the intricately fitted jigsawpuzzle of an architectural mosaic to the mixandmatch literary method by which he has structured nor limestone islands. listen to this tales limestone salesman make a pitch to a roomful of city officials we … want everybody to come and visit us but hardly anybody wants to. right now my country skyhigh stutzamutza is about three miles from here my emphasis. this spiel evokes part three a voyage to laputa of my most admired book in the world gullivers travels. laputas lodestonedirected flying islands first boggled my starving preteen mind in tulsa oklahoma circa 1958. thus in 1984 i chose nor limestone islands to represent r. a. lafferty in an anthology titled light years and dark science fiction and fantasy of introduction by michael bishop nor limestone islands and for our time. and here is how i introduced it how does a 105pound girl assemble a thirtymillionton pink pagoda in six hours r. a. lafferty will tell you in this charming article about floating limestone islands and the intrepid miss phosphor mccabe whose breathtaking photographs of skyhigh stutzamutza see plates i to xxii are unfortunately not included in the text. lafferty you see is famousperhaps notorious is the better wordfor the inveterate unorthodoxy of his story concepts and narrative strategies. his work is immediately recognizable as his in a way that the work of other writers is not always identifiable as theirs and nobody elses. this distinctiveness would seem to leave lafferty wide open to parody but he writes with such droll originality that any attempt to burlesque him turns instead into a pale pastiche of his methods and hence into a kind of homage. new wave old wave who cares lafferty is surfing the crest of a comber whose quirky break only he knows how to ride. that remains pretty much the case today. indeed those who manage to create better than passable parodiescumhommages to lafferty like neil gaiman usually come away from the experience understanding both how hard such stories are to write and why no one else tries to build a career emulating our sui generis raphael aloysius lafferty. nor limestone islands a lapidary is one who cuts polishes engraves and sets small stones. he is also a scrivener with a choppy style who sets in little stones or pieces here and there and attempts to make a mosaic out of them but what do you call one who cuts and sets very large stones take a small lapillus or stone for instance a the origin of painting as an art in greece is connected with definite historical personages but that of sculpture is lost in the mists of legend. its authentic history does not begin until about the year 600 b.c. it was regarded as an art imparted to men by the gods for such is the thought expressed in the assertion that the earliest statues fell from heaven. statuaria ars sculpture harpers dictionary of classical literature and antiquities. we set that little stone in one corner even though it contains a misunderstanding of what fell from heaven it wasnt finished statues. then we set another small stone we havent the exact citation of this. its from charles fort or from one of his imitators. its of a scientist who refused to believe that several pieces of limestone had fallen from the sky even though two farmers had seen them fall. they could not have fallen from the sky the scientist said because there is no limestone in the sky. what would that scientist have done if he had been confronted with the question of whales in the sky we set that little stone of wisdom into one corner. and we look around for other stones to set.  a the limestone salesman was making his pitch to the city commissioners. he had been making a poor pitch and he was a poor salesman. all he had was price much less than one tenth that of the other bidders and superior quality. but the limestone salesman did not make a good appearance. he was bare chested and colossally deepchested. he had only a little shoulder jacket above and a folded drape below. on his feet he had the crepida or hermes sandals made of buckskin apparently a silly affectation. he was darkly burned in skin and hair but the roots of his hair and of his skin indicated that he was blond in both. he was goldenbearded but the beard and in fact the whole man was covered with chalkdust or rockdust. the man was sweaty and he smelled. his was a composite smell of limestone and edged bronze and goats and clover and honey and ozone and lentils and sour milk and dung and strong cheese. no i dont believe that we want to deal with you at all the mayor of the city was saying. the other firms are all reputable and long established. our firm is long established the limestone salesman said. it has been doing business from the sameahcart for nine thousand years. balderdash the streets and sewers commissioner swore. you wont even give us the address of your firm and you havent put in a formal bid. the address is stutzamutza the limestone salesman said. thats all the address i can give you. there isnt any other address. and i will put in a formal bid if you will show me how to do it. i offer you three hundred tons of the finest marblelimestone cut exactly to specification and set in place guaranteed to take care of your project guaranteed to be without flaw in either pure white or variegated i offer this delivered and set within one hour all for the price of three hundred dollars or three hundred bushels of cracked corn. oh take it take it a miss phosphor mccabe cried out. we elect you gentlemen to do our business for us at bargain prices. do not pass up this fine bargain i beg you. phosphor mccabe was a lady photographer who had nine fingers in every pie. و a you be quiet young lady or we will have you put out of the hearing room said the parks and playgrounds commissioner. you will wait your turn and you will not interfere in other cases. i shudder to think what your own petition will be today. was ever a group so put upon by cranks as ourselves you have a very bad reputation man the finance commissioner said to the limestone salesman insofar as anyone has heard of you before. there is some mumble that your limestone or marble is not substantial that it will melt away like hailstones. there is even a rumor that you had something to do with the terrible hailstorm of the night before last. ah we just had a little party at our place that night the limestone salesman said. we had a few dozen bottles of tontitown wine from some stone that we set over in arkansas and we drank it up. we didnt hurt anybody or anything with those hailstones. hey some of them were as big as basketballs werent they but we were careful where we let them fall. how often do you see a hailstorm as wild as that that doesnt do any damage at all to anything we cant afford to look silly the schools and activities commissioner said. we have been made to look silly in quite a few cases lately not all of them our own fault. we cant afford to buy limestone for a project like this from someone like you. i wonder if you could get me about a hundred and twenty tons of good quality pink granite asked a smiling pinkish man in the hearing room. no thats another island entirely the limestone salesman said. ill tell them if i see them. mr. chalupa i dont know what your business is here today the mayor said severely to the smiling pinkish man but you will wait your turn and you will not mix into this case. lately it seems that our open hearings are just one nut after another. how can you lose the limestone salesman asked the commissioners. i will supply and cut and set the stones. if you are not satisfied i will leave the stones at no cost or i will remove them again. and not until you are completely satisfied do you pay me the three hundred dollars or the three hundred bushels of cracked corn. i want to go to your country with you miss phosphor mccabe burst out. i am fascinated by what i have heard of it. i want to do a photographic article about it for the heritage geographical magazine. how far away is your country now all right the limestone salesman said. ill wait for you. well go just as soon as i have transacted my business and you have transacted yours. we like everybody and we want everybody to come and visit us but hardly anybody wants to. right now my country is about three miles from here. last chance gentlemen i offer you the best bargain in quality marble limestone that youll ever find if you live two hundred years. and i hope you do all live to be two hundred. we like everybody and wed like to see everybody live two hundred years at least. absolutely not said the mayor of the city. wed be the laughingstock of the whole state if we did business with someone like you. what kind of a country of yours are you talking about thats only three miles from here absolutely not. you are wasting your time and ours man. no no it just couldnt be said the streets and sewers commissioner. what would the papers print if they heard that we had bought limestone from somebody nearly as disreputable as a saucerian rejected rejected said the parks and playgrounds commissioner. we were elected to transact the citys business with economy and dignity. ah well all right the limestone salesman said. you cant sell a stylobate every time you try. good day commissioners. no hurry lady. ill wait for you. and the limestone salesman went out leaving as it seemed a cloud of rockdust in his wake.  what a day the schools and activities commissioner moaned. what a procession of jokers we have had anyhow that one cant be topped. im not so sure the mayor grumbled. miss phosphor mccabe is next. oh ill be brief phosphor said brightly. all i want is a permit to build a pagoda on that thirtyacre hill that my grandfather left me. it wont interfere with anything. there wont be any utilities to run to it. and it will be pretty. ah why do you want to build a pagoda the streets and sewers commissioner asked. so i can take pictures of it. and just because i want to build a pagoda. what kind of a pagoda will it be the parks and playgrounds commissioner asked. a pink pagoda. how big will it be the schools and activities commissioner asked. thirty acres big. and four hundred feet high. it will be big and it wont bother anything. why do you want it so big the mayor asked. so it will be ten times as big as the black pagoda in india. itll be real pretty and an attraction to the area. do you have the money to build this with the streets and sewers commissioner asked. no i dont have hardly any money. if i sell my photographic article with camera and canoe on skyhigh stutzamutza to the heritage geographical magazine i will get some money for it. and i have been snapping unrehearsed camera portraits of all you gentlemen for the last few minutes and i may be able to sell them to comic weekly if i can think of cute headings for them. as to the money to build the pink pagoda oh ill think of something. miss mccabe your request is remanded or remaindered or whatever which is the same thing as being tabled the mayor said. . what does that mean im not sure. the legal commissioner is absent today but he always says something like that when we want to pass the buck for a little while. it means come back in one week miss mccabe the streets and sewers commissioner said. all right miss phosphor mccabe agreed. i couldnt possibly start on the pink pagoda before a week anyhow. a and now we set this oddshaped stone over in the other corner the seventeenth century discovery of the polynesian islands by common seamen was one of the ancient paradise promises fulfilled. the green islands the blue sea the golden beaches and the golden sunlight the dusky girls fruit incomparable fish incomparable roast pig and baked bird beyond believing breadfruit and volcano absolute and continuing perfection of weather brownskin paradise maidens such as are promised in alcoran song and stringmusic and surfmusic this was the promised paradise of the islands and it came true. but even this was a weak thing beside the less known the earlier and continuing discovery of the floating islands or the travertine islands by more intrepid farers. the girls of the floating islands are lighter except for the cool blacks on the greenstone dolomites than the polynesian maidens they are more intelligent and much more full of fun are more handsome and fullerbodied are of an artier and more vital culture. they are livelier. oh how they are livelier and the regions themselves defy description. for color and zest there is nothing in polynesia or aegea or antilla to compare at all. and all the travertine people are so friendly perhaps it is well that they are little known and little visited. we may be too weak for their experience. facts of the paradise legend by harold bluewater look closely at that little stone ere we leave it. are you sure that you have correctly noted the shape of it then a still smaller stone to be set in here where there seems too empty a little gap. its a mere quotation in lapidary inscription a man is not upon oath. doctor johnson miss phosphor mccabe did visit the limestone salesmans country and she did do the photographic article with camera and canoe in skyhigh stutzamutza. the stunning eyeblowing heartswelling joyfilled color photography cannot be given here but these are a few extracts from the sustaining text stutzamutza is a limestone land of such unbelievable whiteness as to make the eyes ache with delight. it is this superwhiteness as a basis that makes all the other colors stand out with such clarity. there cannot be anywhere a bluer sky than for most of the hours and days surrounds stutzamutza see plates i and ii. there cannot be greener fields where there are fields nor more silvery water plates iv and v. the waterfalls are absolute rainbows especially final falls when it flows clear off the high land plate vi. there cannot be more variegated cliffs blue black pink ochre red green but always with that morewhitethanwhite basic plate vii. there cannot be such a sun anywhere else. it shines here as it shines nowhere on the world. due to the high average elevation of stutzamutza there will be some boggled eyes when i reveal just what i do mean by the average elevation of this place the people are all wonderfully deepchested or deepbreasted. they are like something out of fable. the few visitors who come here from lower from more mundane elevations are uniform in their disbelief. oh oh they will say. there cant be girls like that. there are however see plate viii. how long has this been going on these occasional visitors ask. it has been going on for the nine thousand years of recorded stutzamutza history and beyond that it has been going on as long as the world has been going on. perhaps due to their deepbreastedness the stutzamutza people are superb in their singing. they are lusty they are loud they are beautiful and enchanting in this. their instruments besides the conventional flutes and bagpipes with their great lungpower these people do wonderful things with the bagpipes and lyric harps and tabors are the thunderdrum plate ix and the thirteenfootlong trumpets plates x and xi. it is doubted whether any other people anywhere would be able to blow these roaring trumpets. perhaps it is due also to their deepbreastedness that the stutzamutza people are all so lustily affectionate. there is something both breathtaking and breathgiving in their olympian carnality. they have a robustness and glory in their man and woman interfluents that leave this underdeveloped little girl more than amazed plates x to xix. moreover these people are witty and wise and always pleasant. it is said that originally there was not any soil at all on stutzamutza. the people would trade finest quality limestone marble and dolomite for equal amounts of soil be it the poorest clay or sand. they filled certain crevices with this soil and got vegetation to begin. and in a few thousand years they built countless verdant terraces knolls and valleys. grapes olives and clover are now grown in profusion. wine and oil and honey gladden the deep hearts of the people. the wonderful bluegreen clover see plate xx is grazed by the bees and the goats. there are two separate species of goat the meadow and pasture goat kept for its milk and cheese and mohair and the larger and wilder mountain goat hunted on the white crags and eaten for its flavorsome randy meat. woven mohair and dressed buckskin are used for the stutzamutza clothing. the people are not voluminously clothed in spite of the fact that it becomes quite chilly on the days when the elevation suddenly increases. there is very little grain grown on stutzamutza. mostly quarried stones are bartered for grain. quarrying stone is the main industry it is really the only one on stutzamutza. the great quarries in their cutaways sometimes reveal amazing fossil deposits. there is a complete fossilized body of a whale it is an extinct zeuglodon or eocene whale see plate xxi. if this is whale indeed then this all must have been under ocean once i said to one of my deepchested friends. oh certainly he said nowhere else is limestone formed than in ocean. then how has it risen so far above it i asked. that is something for the geologists and the hyphologists to figure out my friend said. the fascinating aspect of the water on stutzamutza is its changeableness. a lake is sometimes formed in a single day and it may be emptied out in one day again by mere tipping. the rain is prodigious sometimes when it is decided to come into that aspect. to shoot the rapids on the sudden swollen rivers is a delight. sometimes ice will form all over stutzamutza in a very few minutes. the people delight in this sudden ice all except the little under equipped guest. the beauty of it is stupendous so is its cold. they shear the ice off in great sheets and masses and blocks and let it fall for fun. but all lesser views are forgotten when one sees the waterfalls tumbling in the sunlight. and the most wonderful of all of them is final falls. oh to watch it fall clear off stutzamutza see plate xxii to see it fall into practically endless space thirty thousand feet sixty thousand feet turning into mist into sleet or snow or rain or hail depending on the sort of day it is to see the mileslong rainbow of it extending to the vanishing point so far below your feet there is a particularly striking pink marble cliff toward the north end of the land the temporary north end of the land. you like it you can have it my friends say. that is what i had been fishing for them to say. yes miss phosphor mccabe did the really stunning photographic article for heritage geographical magazine. heritage geographical did not accept it however. miss phosphor mccabe had arrived at some unacceptable conclusions the editor said. what really happened is that i arrived at an unacceptable place miss phosphor said. i remained there for six days. i photographed it and i narrated it. ah wed never get by with that the editor said. part of the trouble was miss phosphor mccabes explanations of just what she did mean by the average elevation of stutzamutza it was quite high and by days of increasing elevation.  now here is another stone of silly shape. at first glimpse it will not seem possible to fit it into the intended gap. but the eye is deceived this shape will fit into the gap nicely. it is a recollection in age of a thing observed during a long lifetime by a fine weather eye. already as a small boy i was interested in clouds. i believed that certain clouds preserve their identities and appear again and again and that some clouds are more solid than others. later when i took meteorology and weather courses at the university i had a classmate who held a series of seemingly insane beliefs. at the heart of these was the theory that certain apparent clouds are not vapor masses at all but are floating stone islands in the sky. he believed that there were some thirty of these islands most of them composed of limestone but some of them of basalt or sandstone even of shale. he said that one at least of them was composed of potstone or soapstone. this classmate said that these floating islands were sometimes large one of them being at least five miles long that they were intelligently navigated to follow the best camouflage the limestone islands usually traveling with masses of white fleecy clouds the basalt islands traveling with dark thunderheads and so on. he believed that these islands sometimes came to rest on earth that each of them had its own several nests in unfrequented regions. and he believed that the floating islands were peopled. we had considerable fun with mad anthony tummley our eccentric classmate. his ideas we told each other were quite insane. and indeed anthony himself was finally institutionalized. it was a sad case but one that could hardly be discussed without laughter. but later after more than fifty years in the weather profession i have come to the conclusion that anthony tummley was right in every respect. several of us veteran weathermen share this knowledge now but we have developed a sort of code for the thing not daring to admit it openly even to ourselves. whales in the sky is the codename for this study and we pretend to keep it on a humorous basis. some thirty of these floating stone islands are continuously over our own country there may be more than a hundred of them in the world. they are tracked on radar they are sighted again and again in their slightly changed forms some of them now and then seem to slough off small masses of stone and deposit it somehow on earth they are known they are named. they are even visited by some persons of odd character always a peculiar combination of simplicity acceptance intelligence and strange rapport. there are persons and families in rural situations who employ these peopled islands to carry messages and goods for them. in rural and swampland louisiana there was once some wonder that the people did not more avail themselves of the intercoastal canal barges to carry their supplies and their products to market. how are the barges better than the stone islands that we have always used these people ask. they arent on a much more regular schedule they arent much faster and they wont give you anything like the same amount of service in exchange for a hundredweight of rice. besides that the stoneisland people are our friends and some of them have intermarried with us cajuns. there are other regions where the same easy cooperation obtains. many of the stoneisland people are well known along certain almost regular routes. these people are all of a powerful and rather coarse beauty. they are goodnatured and hearty. they actually traffic in stone trading amazing tonnages of top grade building stone for grain and other simple provisions. there is no scientific explanation at all of how these things can be how the stone islands are able to float in the sky. but that they do so is the open secret of perhaps a million persons. really i am now too wealthy to be put in a madhouse though i made my money in a rather mad traffic which would not be generally believed. i am too old to be laughed at openly i will merely be smiled at as an eccentric. i have now retired from that weather profession which served me as a front for many years which profession however i loved and still love. i know what i know. there are more things in the zone fifteen miles above the earth than are dreamed of in your philosophy horatio. memories of 52 years as a weather observer by hank fairday privately printed 1970 miss phosphor mccabe did another really stunning photographic article for the heritage geographical magazine. it had a catchy title all right then you tell me how i did it or the building of the pink pagoda. the pink pagoda is complete except for such additions as i shall have made whenever the notion strikes me and whenever my highflying friends are in the neighborhood. it is by far the largest structure in the world and also in my opinion the most beautiful. but it is not massive in appearance it is light and airy. come see it in the stone all of you come see it in the color photography plates i to cxxix if you are not able to come yourself. this wonderful structure gives the answers to hundreds of questions if you will just open your eyes and your ears. of ancient megalithic structures it has sometimes been asked how a hundred or more of onehundred ton blocks of stone could have been piled up and fitted so carefully that even a knifeblade could not be inserted between the blocks. its easy. you usually dont set a hundred onehundred ton blocks unless for a certain ornamentation. you set one tenthousand ton block and the joinings are merely simulated. in the pink pagoda i have had set blocks as heavy as three hundred thousand tons of pink limestone see plate xxi. they bring the whole island down in place. they split off what block is wanted at that location and believe me they are some splitters then they withdraw the island a little bit and leave the block in place. well how else was it done how did i get the onehundredandfifty thousand ton main capstone in place fourhundredandfiftyfeet in the air with ramps oh stop it youll scare the cuckoos. the stone pillars and turrets all around and below it are like threedimensional lacework and that main capstone had to go on last. it wasnt done by rocking it up on ramps even if there had been a place for the ramps. it was all done on one saturday afternoon and here are the sequence pictures showing just how it was done. it was done by using a floating island and by detaching pieces of that island as it was floated into place. i tell you that there is no other way that a one hundredandfive pound girl can assemble a thirtymillion ton pink pagoda in six hours. she has got to have a floating island with a north cliff of pink limestone and she has got to be very good friends with the people on that island. please come and see my pink pagoda. all the people and all the officials avert their eyes from it. they say that it is impossible that such a thing could be there and therefore it cannot be there. but it is there. see it yourself or see plates iv ix xxxiii lxx especially. and it is pretty see plates xix xxiv v liv. but best come see it as it really is. miss phosphor mccabe did that rather astonishing photographic article for the heritage geographical magazine. heritage geographical refused to publish it though stating that such things were impossible. and they refused to come and see the pink pagoda itself which is a pity since it is the largest and most beautiful structure on earth. it stands there yet on that thirtyacre hill right on the north edge of town. and you have not heard the last stone of it yet. the latest a badnatured little addition will not be the last miss phosphor swears that it will not be. there was a flimsywinged enemy flew down shortly after the first completion of the pagoda and set the latest very small stone it is called the eggofdoubt stone on top of the main capstone. twas a crabbed written little stone and it read  i will not trow twoheaded calves say neverseens and also haves. that crabby little balladstone on the top almost spoils the pink pagoda for me. but it will be removed miss phosphor mccabe says just as soon as her traveling friends are back in this neighborhood and she can get up there. that is all that we have to say on the subject of stone setting. does anyone else have something further to add ill not believe a hollow earth say skepticals of doubtful birth. ill not concede atlantis you nor yet lemuria or mu nor woodsmen in northwestern lands nor bandyleggd saucerians nor ancient technologic myth nor charm of timeless megalith. i will not credit whales that fly nor limestone islands in the sky. unfolk ballad although his okla hannali will surely someday take its proper place alongside huckleberry finn and mobydick as one of the great american novels raphael aloysius lafferty is more known for his short stories than his novels. and not all that widely known. for lafferty is that most tender wretched and essential of creatures the writers writer celebrated by beloved of but mostly visible only check the intros to his own proud primitive tribe. and even in the cult we call sf lafferty is an outlier a dark star a visitor from the oort cloud of literature. our poet. not romantic how much more pallid bradbury but rather elizabethan in the exuberant precision of his words metaphysical in the playful contrariness of his ideas. difficult but fun. no not the most important writer of sfs postgolden age. how could such an original prevail but how not persist once discovered he is never let go. he is with us forever. his is a slant spell but once you fall under it you remain enchanted. so here is interurban queen. not his greatest story its a middling lafferty which places it in the top rank of short fiction worldwide. its an alternate history a form lafferty a conservative midwestern engineer often used as a lever to upend his familiar oklahoma quotidian. its a utopian tale another field in which lafferty liked to romp with a solid business engine and a sunny murderous heart. come along. you are on an outing with your greatgranddaughter through the green and pleasant landscape of your dreams. introduction by terry bisson interurban queen rifles are handed out. it was the year 1907 when i attained my majority and came into a considerable inheritance the old man said. i was a very keen young man keen enough to know that i didnt know everything. i went to knowledgeable men and asked their advice as to how i might invest this inheritance. i talked with bankers and cattlemen and the new oilmen. these were not stodgy men. they had an edge on the future and they were excited and exciting about the way that money might be made to grow. it was the year of statehood and there was an air of prosperity over the new state. i wished to integrate my patrimony into that new prosperity. finally i narrowed my choice to two investments which then seemed about of equal prospect though you will now smile to hear them equated. one of them was the stockselling company of a certain harvey goodrich a rubber company and with the new automobile coming into wider use it seemed that rubber might be a thing of the future. the other was a stock selling transportation company that proposed to run an interurban railway between the small towns of kiefer and mounds. it also proposed at a future time to run branches to glenpool to bixby to kellyville to slick to bristow to beggs even to okmulgee and sapulpa. at that time it also seemed that these little interurban railways might be things of the future. an interurban already ran between tulsa and sand springs and one was building between tulsa and sapulpa. there were more than one thousand of these small trolley railroads operating in the nation and thoughtful men believed that they would come to form a complete national network might become the main system of transportation. interurban queen a but now the old man charles archer was still a young man. he was listening to joe elias a banker in a small but growing town. it is a riddle you pose me young man and you set me thinking elias said. we have dabbled in both thinking to have an egg under every hen. i begin to believe that we were wrong to do so. these two prospects are types of two futures and only one of them will obtain. in this state with its new oil discoveries it might seem that we should be partial to rubber which has a tie in with the automobile which has a tiein with petroleum fuel. this need not be. i believe that the main use of oil will be in powering the new factories and i believe that rubber is already oversold as to industrial application. and yet there will be a new transportation. between the horse and the mainline railways there is a great gap. i firmly believe that the horse will be eliminated as a main form of transportation. we are making no more loans to buggy or buckboard manufacturers nor to harness makers. i have no faith in the automobile. it destroys something in me. it is the interurbans that will go into the smallest localities and will so cut into the mainline railroads as to leave no more than a half dozen of the longdistance major lines in america. young man i would invest in the interurban with complete confidence. charles archer was listening to carl bigheart a cattleman. i ask you boy how many head of cattle can you put into an automobile or even into what they call a lorry or trook then i ask you how many you can put into an honest cattle car which can be coupled onto any interurban on a country run the interurban will be the salvation of us cattlemen. with the fencing regulations we cannot drive cattle even twenty miles to a railroad but the little interurbans will go into the deep country running along every second or third section line. and i will tell you another thing boy there is no future for the automobile. we cannot let there be consider the man on horseback and i have been a man on horseback for most of my life. well mostly he is a good man but there is a change in him as soon as he mounts. every man on horseback is an arrogant man however gentle he may be on foot. i know this in myself and in others. he was necessary in his own time and i believe that time is ending. there was always extreme danger from the man on horseback. believe me young man the man in the automobile is one thousand times as dangerous. the kindest man in the world assumes an incredible arrogance when he drives an automobile and this arrogance will increase still further if the machine is allowed to develop greater power and sophistication. i tell you it will engender absolute selfishness in mankind if the driving of automobiles becomes common. it will breed violence on a scale never seen before. it will mark the end of the family as we know it the three or four generations living happily in one home. it will destroy the sense of neighborhood and the true sense of nation. it will create giantized cankers of cities false opulence of suburbs ruinized countryside and unhealthy conglomeration of specialized farming and manufacturing. it will breed rootlessness and immorality. it will make every man a tyrant. i believe the private automobile will be suppressed. it will have to be this is a moral problem and we are a moral nation and world we will take moral action against it. and without the automobile rubber has no real future. opt for the interurban stock young man. young charles archer was listening to nolan cushman an oilman. i will not lie to you young fellow i love the automobile the motorcar. i have three custombuilt. i am an emperor when i drive. hell im an emperor anyhow i bought a castle last summer that had housed emperors. im having it transported stone by stone to my place in the osage. now as to the motorcar i can see how it should develop. it should develop with the roads they becoming leveled and metaled or concreted and the cars lower and lower and faster and faster. we would develop them so if we were some species other than human. it is the logical development but i hope it will not come and it will not. that would be to make it common and the commonality of men cannot be trusted with this power. besides i love a high car and i do not want there to be very many of them. they should only be allowed to men of extreme wealth and flair. how would it be if the workingmen were ever permitted them it would be murderous if they should come into the hands of ordinary men. how hellish a world would it be if all men should become as arrogant as myself no the automobile will never be anything but a rich mans pride the rubber will never be anything but a limited adjunct to that special thing. invest in your interurban. it is the thing of the future or else i dread that future.  young charles archer knew that this was a crossroads of the world. whichever turning was taken it would predicate a certain sort of nation and world and humanity. he thought about it deeply. then he decided. he went out and invested his entire inheritance in his choice.  i considered the two investments and i made my choice said charles archer the old man now in the now present. i put all i had into it thirtyfive thousand dollars a considerable sum in those days. you know the results. i am one of the results greatgrandfather said angela archer. if you had invested differently you would have come to different fortune you would have married differently and i would be different or not at all. i like me here and now. i like everything as it is. three of them were out riding early one saturday morning the old man charles archer his greatgranddaughter angela and her fiancé peter brady. they were riding through the quasiurbia the rich countryside. it was not a main road and yet it had a beauty partly natural and partly contrived that was as exciting as it was satisfying. water always beside the roadway that was the secret there were the carp ponds one after another. there were the hatcheries. there were the dancing rocky streams that in a less enlightened age might have been mere gutter runs or roadway runs. there were the small and rapid trout streams and boys were catching big trout from them. there were the deep bushtrees there sumac witch hazel sassafras incense trees they might almost have been. there were the great trees themselves pecan and hickory and black walnut standing like high backdrops and between were the lesser trees willow cottonwood sycamore. catheads and sedge grass and reeds stood in the water itself and tall sudan grass and bluestem on the shores. and always the clovers there and the smell a a  of wet sweet clover. i chose the wrong one said old charles archer as they rode along through the textured country. one can now see how grotesque was my choice but i was young. in two years the stockselling company in which i had invested was out of business and my loss was total. so early and easy riches were denied me but i developed an ironic hobby keeping track of the stock of the enterprise in which i did not invest. the stock i could have bought for thirtyfive thousand dollars would now make me worth nine million dollars. ugh dont talk of such a thing on such a beautiful day angela objected. they heard another of them last night peter brady commented. theyve been hearing this one off and on for a week now and havent caught him yet. i always wish they wouldnt kill them when they catch them angela bemoaned. it doesnt seem quite right to kill them. a goosegirl was herding her white honking charges as they gobbled weeds out of fields of morning onions. flowering kale was shining green purple and okra plants were standing. jersey cows grazed along the roadway and the patterned plastic almost as patterned as the grasses filled the roadway itself. there were clouds like yellow dust in the air. bees stingless bees they were. but dust itself was not. that there never be dust again they will have to find out and kill the sly klunker makers said old man charles archer. stop the poison at its source. theres too many of them and too much money in it said peter brady. yes we kill them. one of them was found and killed thursday and three nearly finished klunkers were destroyed. but we cant kill them all. they seem to come out of the ground like snakes. i wish we didnt have to kill them angela said. there were brightly colored firkins of milk standing on loading stoas for this was a milk shed. there were chickens squawking in ninestoryhigh coops as they waited the pickups but they never had to wait long. here were a thousand dozen eggs on a refrigeration porch there a clutch of piglings or of red steers. tomato plants were staked two meters high. sweetcorn stood not yet come to tassel. they passed cucumber vines and cantaloupe vines and the potato hills rising up bluegreen. ah there were grapevines in their tight acres deep alfalfa meadows living fences of osage orange and whitethorn. carrot tops zephyred like green lace. cattle were grazing fields of red clover and of peanutsthat most magic of all clovers. men mowed hay. i hear him now peter brady said suddenly. you couldnt. not in the daytime. dont even think of such a thing angela protested. farm ducks were grazing with their heads under water in the roadway ponds and farm ponds. bower oaks grew high in the roadway parks. sheep fed in hay grazer that was higher than their heads they were small white islands in it. there was local wine and choc beer and cider for sale at small booths along with limestone sculpture and painted fruitwood carvings. kids danced on loading stoas to little postmounted music canisters and goats licked slate outcroppings in search of some new mineral. the saturday riders passed a roadway restaurant with its tables out under the leaves and under a little rock overhang. a onemeterhigh waterfall gushed through the middle of the establishment and a twometerlong bridge of set shale stone led to the kitchen. then they broke onto view after never tiring view of the rich and varied quasiurbia. the roadway farms the fringe farms the berry patches in their seasons juneberries huckleberries blueberries dewberries elderberries highbush cranberries red raspberries boysenberries loganberries nine kinds of blackberries strawberries greenberries. orchards can there ever be enough orchards plum peach sand plum and chokecherry black cherry apple and crab apple pear bluefruited pawpaw persimmon crooked quince. melon patches congregations of beehives pickle patches cheese farms flax farms close clustered towns twenty houses in each twenty persons in a house twenty of the little settlements along every mile of roadway country honkytonks as well as highdog clubs already open and hopping with action in the early morning roadway chapels with local statuary and with their richboxpoorboxes one dropped money in the top if one had it and the spirit to give it one tripped it out the bottom if one needed it and the little refrigeration niches with bread cheese beef rolls and always the broached cask of country wine that there be no more hunger on the roadways forever i hear it too old charles archer cried out suddenly. highpitched and off to the left. and theres the smell of monoxide and gahrubber. conductor conductor the conductor heard it as did others in the car. the conductor stopped the cars to listen. then he phoned the report and gave the location as well as he might consulting with the passengers. there was rough country over to the left rocks and hills and someone was driving there in broad daylight. the conductor broke out rifles from the locker passing them out to peter brady and two other young men in the car and to three men in each of the other two cars. a competentseeming man took over the communication talking to men on a line further to the left beyond the mad driver and they had him boxed into a box no more than half a mile square. you stay angela and you stay grandfather archer peter brady said. here is a little thirty carbine. use it if he comes in range at all. we hunt him down now. then peter brady followed the conductor and the riflebearing men ten men on a death hunt. and there were now four other groups out on the hunt converging on their whining coughing target. why do they have to kill them greatgrandfather why not turn them over to the courts the courts are too lenient. all they give them is life in prison. but surely that should be enough. it will keep them from driving the things and some of the unfortunate men might even be rehabilitated. angela they are the greatest prison breakers ever. only ten days ago mad man gudge killed three guards went over the wall at state prison evaded all pursuit robbed the cheesemakers cooperative of fifteen thousand dollars got to a sly klunker maker and was driving one of the things in a wild area within thirty hours of his breakout. it was four days before they found him and killed him. they are insane angela and the mental hospitals are already full of them. not one of them has ever been rehabilitated. why is it so bad that they should drive they usually drive only in the very wild places and for a few hours in the middle of the night. their madness is infectious angela. their arrogance would leave no room for anything else in the world. our country is now in balance our communication and travel is minute and near perfect thanks to the wonderful a trolleys and the people of the trolleys. we are all one neighborhood we are all one family we live in love and compassion with few rich and few poor and arrogance and hatred have all gone out from us. we are the people with roots and with trolleys. we are one with our earth. would it hurt that the drivers should have their own limited place to do what they wanted if they did not bother sane people would it hurt if disease and madness and evil were given their own limited place but they will not stay in their place angela. there is the diabolical arrogance in them the rampant individualism the hatred of order. there can be nothing more dangerous to society than the man in the automobile. were they allowed to thrive there would be poverty and want again angela and wealth and accumulation. and cities. but cities are the most wonderful things of all i love to go to them. i do not mean the wonderful excursion cities angela. there would be cities of another and blacker sort. they were almost upon us once when a limitation was set on them. uniqueness is lost in them there would be mere accumulation of rootless people of arrogant people of duplicated people of people who have lost their humanity. let them never rob us of our involuted countryside or our quasiurbia. we are not perfect but what we have we will not give away for the sake of wild men. the smell i cannot stand it monoxide. how would you like to be born in the smell of it to live every moment of your life in the smell of it to die in the smell of it no no not that. the rifleshots were scattered but serious. the howling and coughing of the illicit klunker automobile were nearer. then it was in sight bouncing and bounding weirdly out of the rough rock area and into the tomato patches straight toward the trolley interurban. the klunker automobile was on fire giving off the ghastly stench of burning leather and rubber and noxious monoxide and seared human flesh. the man standing up at the broken wheel was a madman howling out of his head. he was a young man but sunkeneyed and unshaven bloodied on the left side of his head and the left side of his breast foaming with hatred and arrogance. kill me kill me he croaked like clattering broken thunder. there will be others we will not leave off driving so long as there is one desolate place left so long as there is one sly klunker maker left he went rigid. he quivered. he was shot again. but he would die howling. damn you all to trolley haven a man in an automobile is worth a thousand men on foot he is worth a million men in a trolley car you never felt your black heart rise up in you when you took control of one of the monsters you never felt the lively hate choke you off in rapture as you sneered down the whole world from your bouncing center of the universe damn all decent folks id rather go to hell in an automobile than to heaven in a trolley car a spoked wheel broke sounding like one of the muted volleys of rifle fire coming from behind him. the klunker automobile pitched onto its nose upended turned over and exploded in blasting flames. and still in the middle of the fire could be seen the two hypnotic eyes with their darker flame could be heard the demented voice the crankshaft will still be good the differential will still be good a sly klunker maker can use part of it part of it will drive againahhhiiii. some of them sang as they rode away from the site in the trolley cars and some of them were silent and thoughtful. it had been an unnerving thing. it curdles me to remember that i once put my entire fortune into that future greatgrandfather charles archer moaned. well that is better than to have lived in such a future.   a young couple had happily loaded all their belongings onto a baggage trolley and were moving from one of the excursion cities to live with kindred in quasiurbia. the population of that excursion city with its wonderful theaters and music halls and distinguished restaurants and literary coffeehouses and alcoholic oases and amusement centers had now reached seven thousand persons the legal limit for any city oh there were a thousand excursion cities and all of them delightful but a limit must be kept on size. a limit must be kept on everything. it was a wonderful saturday afternoon. fowlers caught birds with a collapsible kitecornered nets. kids rode free out to the diamonds to play trolley league ball. old gaffers rode out with pigeons in pigeon boxes to turn them loose and watch them race home. shore netters took shrimp from the semisaline little shrimp lake. banjo players serenaded their girls in grassy lanes. the world was one single bronze gong song with the melodious clang of trolley cars threading the country on their greeniron rails with the sparky fire following them overhead and their copper gleaming in the sun. by law there must be a trolley line every mile but they were oftener. by law no one trolley line might run for more than twentyfive miles. this was to give a sense of locality. but transfers between the lines were worked out perfectly. if one wished to cross the nation one rode on some one hundred and twenty different lines. there were no more longdistance railroads. they also had had their arrogance and they also had had to go. carp in the ponds pigs in the clover a unique barn factory in every hamlet and every hamlet unique bees in the air pepper plants in the lanes and the whole land as sparky as trolley fire and right as rails. thus we frustrate charlemagne introduction by jack dann rump of skunk and madness or how to read r. a. lafferty yes it looks perfectly simple on the surface ... laffertys prose is short on adjectives and long on what would seem to be the voice of the american tall tale. his characters are ciphers seemingly onedimensional caricatures and the tall voice is innocently jocular as it seems to invent its own convoluted syntax explains historical incidents at length punctuates events with impossibly overthetop details and tramples through philosophical swamplands like paul bunyan in a hurry to get to the end of the story. we cant help but notice that there is more going on than we can see and although there are bits and pieces we dont understandwords we dont know incidents and outré theories that may or may not be historically correct ostensibly irrelevant sidebarswe cant get off the runaway train until it ... stops. as is widely acknowledged lafferty is a oneoff. he cant be imitated. hes been compared to gene wolfe because of the influence and presence of christianity in his work and hes been compared to mark twain probably for the yarnish nature of his prose. but comparisons dont really work with lafferty. after all the comparisons are made we are still left wondering what the hell just happened after we read a lafferty story. and why do these stories stick in our minds like childhood memory like fairy tales that scared the bejesus out of us... perhaps its because they are just that philosophical fairy tales for adults. and so to thus we frustrate charlemagne which for my money is one of his best short stories it is quintessential lafferty and it works on all the levels sure to leave you scratching your head as the parable inserts itself firmly into your memory. the story is classic counterfactual fiction it is an illustration of what happens when you change history to create alternate history and it comes into being through the writers choice of a divergence point which creates a new branch that confounds history as we think we know it. lafferty will leave you to tangle with the possible consequences of the battle of roncesvalles and william of occams concept of terminalism. and if youre as obsessive as i am youll probably find yourself looking up some terms. all that aside consider as you read whether this is a science fiction story at all ... or whether it might just be an antiscience fiction story. the author playfully uses the tropes of science fiction of alternate history but the science is pretty much just another version of magic a trope in itself. and the history ... we believe it because lafferty sprinkles in such learned esoterica that it somehow feels right. and some of it is suffice it to say the story youre about to read is simple and confusing and makes absolute sense welcome to the antinomical lafferty. welcome to his happily constructed dystopia. as the critic and scholar don webb said laffertys fiction creates the unknown rather than the known. enjoy the peep show. thus we frustrate charlemagne  a weve been on some tall ones said gregory smirnov of the institute but weve never stood on the edge of a bigger one than this nor viewed one with shakier expectations. still if the calculations of epiktistes are correct this will work. people it will work epikt said. this was epiktistes the ktistec machine whod have believed it the main bulk of epikt was five floors below them but he had run an extension of himself up to this little penthouse lounge. all it took was a cable no more than a yard in diameter and a functional head set on the end of it. and what a head he chose it was a seaserpent head a dragon head five feet long and copied from an old carnival float. epikt had also given himself human speech of a sort a blend of irish and jewish and dutch comedian patter from ancient vaudeville. epikt was a comic to his last paradna relay when he rested his huge boggleeyed crested head on the table there and smoked the biggest stogies ever born. but he was serious about this project. we have perfect test conditions the machine epikt said as though calling them to order. we set out basic texts and we take careful note of the world as it is. if the world changes then the texts should change here before our eyes. for our test pilot we have taken that portion of our own middle sized city that can be viewed from this fine vantage point. if the world in its pastpresent continuity is changed by our meddling then the face of our city will also change instantly as we watch it. we have assembled here the finest minds and judgments in the world eight humans and one ktistec machine myself. remember that there are nine of us. it might be important. the nine finest minds were epiktistes the transcendent machine who put the k in ktistec gregory smirnov the largesouled director of the institute valery mok an incandescent lady scientist her overshadowed and overintelligent husband charles cogsworth the humorless and inerrant glasser aloysius shiplap the seminal genius willy mcgilly a man of unusual parts the seeing third finger on his left hand he had picked up on one of the planets of kapteyns star and no false modesty audifax ohanlon and diogenes pontifex. the latter two men were not members of the institute on account of the minimal decency rule but when the finest minds in the world are assembled these two cannot very well be left out. we are going to tamper with one small detail in past history and note its effect gregory said. this has never been done before openly. we go back to an era that has been called a patch of light in the vast gloom the time of charlemagne. we consider why that light went out and did not kindle others. the world lost four hundred years by that flame expiring when the tinder was apparently ready for it. we go back to that false dawn of europe and consider where it failed. the year was 778 and the region was spain. charlemagne had entered alliance with marsilies the arab king of saragossa against the caliph abd arrahmen of córdova. charlemagne took such towns as pamplona huesca and gerona and cleared the way to marsilies in saragossa. the caliph accepted the situation. saragossa should be independent a city open to both moslems and christians. the northern marches to the border of france should be permitted their christianity and there would be peace for everybody. this marsilies had long treated christians as equals in saragossa and now there would be an open road from islam into the frankish empire. marsilies gave charlemagne thirtythree scholars moslem jewish and christian and some spanish mules to seal the bargain. and there could have been a crossfertilization of cultures. but the road was closed at roncesvalles where the rearguard of charlemagne was ambushed and destroyed on its way back to france. the ambushers were more basque than moslems but charlemagne locked the  a door at the pyrenees and swore that he would not let even a bird fly over that border thereafter. he kept the road closed as did his son and his grandsons. but when he sealed off the moslem world he also sealed off his own culture. in his latter years he tried a revival of civilization with a ragtag of irish halfscholars greek vagabonds and roman copyists who almost remembered an older rome. these werent enough to revive civilization and yet charlemagne came close with them. had the islam door remained open a real revival of learning might have taken place then rather than four hundred years later. we are going to arrange that the ambush at roncesvalles did not happen and that the door between the two civilizations was not closed. then we will see what happens to us. intrusion like a burglar bent said epikt. whos a burglar glasser demanded. i am epikt said. we all are. its from an old verse. i forget the author i have it filed in my main mind downstairs if youre interested. we set out a basic text of hilarius gregory continued. we note it carefully and we must remember it the way it is. very soon that may be the way it was. i believe that the words will change on the very page of this book as we watch them. just as soon as we have done what we intend to do. the basic text marked in the open book read   the traitor gano playing a multiplex game with money from the córdova caliph hired basque christians dressed as saragossan mozarabs to ambush the rearguard of the frankish force. to do this it was necessary that gano keep in contact with the basques and at the same time delay the rearguard of the franks. gano however served both as guide and scout for the franks. the ambush was effected. charlemagne lost his spanish mules. and he locked the door against the moslem world. that was the text by hilarius. when we as it were push the button give the nod to epiktistes this will be changed gregory said. epikt by a complex of devices which he has assembled will send an avatar partly of mechanical and partly of ghostly construction and something will have happened to the traitor gano along about sundown one night on the road to roncesvalles. i hope the avatar isnt expensive willy mcgilly said. when i was a »  a boy we got by with a dart whittled out of slippery elm wood. this is no place for humor glasser protested. who did you as a boy ever kill in time willy lots of them. king wu of the manchu pope adrian vii president hardy of our own country king marcel of auvergne the philosopher gabriel toeplitz. its a good thing we got them. they were a bad lot. but i never heard of any of them willy glasser insisted. of course not. we killed them when they were kids. enough of your fooling willy gregory cut it off. willys not fooling the machine epikt said. where do you think i got the idea regard the world aloysius said softly. we see our own middlesized town with half a dozen towers of pastelcolored brick. we will watch it as it grows or shrinks. it will change if the world changes. theres two shows in town i havent seen valery said. dont let them take them away after all there are only three shows in town. we regard the beautiful arts as set out in the reviews here which we have also taken as basic texts audifax ohanlon said. you can say what you want to but the arts have never been in meaner shape. painting is of three schools only all of them bad. sculpture is the heapsofrustedmetal school and the obscene tinkertoy effects. the only popular art graffiti on mingitorio walls has become unimaginative stylized and ugly. the only thinkers to be thought of are the dead teilhard de chardin and the stillborn sartre zielinski aichinger. oh well if youre going to laugh theres no use going on. all of us here are experts on something cogsworth said. most of us are experts on everything. we know the world as it is. let us do what we are going to do and then look at the world. push the button epikt gregory smirnov ordered. from his depths epiktistes the ktistec machine sent out an avatar partly of mechanical and partly of ghostly construction. along about sundown on the road from pamplona to roncesvalles on august 14th of the year 778 the traitor gano was taken up from the road and hanged on a carob tree the only one in those groves of oak and beech. and all things thereafter were changed.  did it work epikt is it done louis lobachevski demanded. i cant see a change in anything. the avatar is back and reports his mission accomplished epikt stated. i cant see any change in anything either. lets look at the evidence gregory said. the thirteen of them the ten humans and the ktistec chresmoeidec and proaisthematic machines turned to the evidence and with mounting disappointment. there is not one word changed in the hilarius text gregory grumbled and indeed the basic text still read the king marsilies of saragossa playing a multiplex game took money from the caliph of córdova for persuading charlemagne to abandon the conquest of spain which charlemagne had never considered and couldnt have effected took money from charlemagne in recompense for the cities of the northern marches being returned to christian rule though marsilies himself had never ruled them and took money from everyone as toll on the new trade passing through his city. marsilies gave up nothing but thirtythree scholars the same number of mules and a few wagonloads of book manuscripts from the old hellenistic libraries. but a road over the mountains was opened between the two worlds and also a sector of the mediterranean coast became open to both. a limited opening was made between the two worlds and a limited reanimation of civilization was effected in each. no there is not one word of the text changed gregory grumbled. history followed its same course. how did our experiment fail we tried by a device that seems a little cloudy now to shorten the gestation period for the new birth. it would not be shortened. the town is in no way changed said aloysius shiplap. it is still a fine large town with two dozen imposing towers of varicolored limestone and midland marble. it is a vital metropolis and we all love it but it is now as it was before. there are still two dozen good shows in town that i havent seen valery said happily as she examined the billings. i was afraid that something might have happened to them. there is no change at all in the beautiful arts as reflected in the reviews here that we have taken as basic texts said audifax ohanlon. you can say a what you want to but the arts have never been in finer shape. its a link of sausage said the machine chresmoeidy. nor know the road who never ran it thrice said the machine proaisth. thats from an old verse i forget the author i have it filed in my main mind in england if youre interested. oh yes its the threecornered tale that ends where it begins said the machine epiktistes. but it is good sausage and we should enjoy it many ages have not even this much. what are you fellows babbling about audifax asked without really wanting to know. the art of painting is still almost incandescent in its bloom. the schools are like clustered galaxies and half the people are doing some of this work for pleasure. scandinavian and maori sculpture are hard put to maintain their dominance in the field where almost everything is extraordinary. the impassionedcomic has released music from most of its bonds. since speculative mathematics and psychology have joined the popular performing arts there is considerably more sheer fun in life. theres a piece here on pete teilhard putting him into context as a talented science fiction writer with a talent for outré burlesque. the brainworld motif was overworked when he tackled it but what a shaggy comic extravaganza he did make of it and theres muldoom zielinski popper gander aichinger whitecrow hornwhangerwe owe so much to the juice of the cultists in the main line there are whole congeries and continents of great novels and novelists. an ever popular art graffiti on mingitorio walls maintains its excellence. travel unlimited offers a ninetynineday art tour of the world keyed to the viewing of the exquisite and hilarious miniatures on the walls of its own restrooms. ah what a copious world we live in its more grass than we can graze said willy mcgilly. the very bulk of achievement is stupefying. ah i wonder if there is subtle revenge in my choice of words. the experiment of course was a failure and im glad. i like a full world. we will not call the experiment a failure since we have covered only a third of it said gregory. tomorrow we will make our second attempt on the past. and if there is a present left to us after that we will make a third attempt the following day. shove it good people shove it the machine epiktistes said. we will meet here again tomorrow. now you to your pleasures and we to ours. the people talked that evening away from the machines where they could make foolish conjectures without being laughed at. lets pull a random card out of the pack and go with it said louis lobachevski. lets take a purely intellectual crux of a little later date and see if the changing of it will change the world. i suggest ockham said johnny konduly. why valery demanded. he was the last and least of the medieval schoolmen. how could anything he did or did not do affect anything oh no he held the razor to the jugular gregory said. hed have severed the vein if the razor hadnt been snatched from his hand. there is something amiss here though. it is as though i remembered when things were not so stark with ockham as though in some variant ockhams terminalism did not mean what we know that it did mean. sure lets cut the jugular said willy. lets find out the logical termination of terminalism and see just how deep ockhams razor can cut. well do it said gregory. our world has become something of a fat slob it cloys it has bothered me all evening. we will find whether purely intellectual attitudes are of actual effect. well leave the details to epikt but i believe the turning point was in the year 1323 when john lutterell came from oxford to avignon where the holy see was then situated. he brought with him fiftysix propositions taken from ockhams commentary on the sentences and he proposed their condemnation. they were not condemned outright but ockham was whipped soundly in that first assault and he never recovered. lutterell proved that ockhams nihilism was a bunch of nothing. and the ockham thing did die away echoing dimly through the little german courts where ockham traveled peddling his wares but he no longer peddled them in the main markets. yet his viewpoint could have sunk the world if indeed intellectual attitudes are of actual effect. we wouldnt have liked lutterell said aloysius. he was humorless and he had no fire in him and he was always right. and we would have liked ockham. he was charming and he was wrong and perhaps we will destroy the world yet. theres a chance that we will get our reaction if we allow ockham free hand. china was frozen for thousands of years by an intellectual attitude one not nearly so unsettling as ockhams. india is hypnotized into a queer stasis which calls itself revolutionary and which does not move hypnotized by an intellectual attitude. but there was never such an attitude as ockhams. so they decided that the former chancellor of oxford john lutterell who was always a sick man should suffer one more sickness on the road to avignon in france and that he should not arrive there to lance the ockham thing before it infected the world. lets get on with it good people epikt rumbled the next day. me im to stop a man getting from oxford to avignon in the year 1323. well come come take your places and lets get the thing started. and epiktistess great seaserpent head glowed every color as he puffed on a sevenbranched pookadooka and filled the room with wonderful smoke. everybody ready to have his throat cut gregory asked cheerfully. cut them said diogenes pontifex but i havent much hope for it. if our yesterdays essay had no effect i cannot see how one english schoolman chasing another to challenge him in an italian court in france in bad latin nearly seven hundred years ago on fiftysix points of unscientific abstract reasoning can have effect. we have perfect test conditions here said the machine epikt. we set out a basic text from cobblestones history of philosophy. if our test is effective then the text will change before our eyes. so will every other text and the world. we have assembled here the finest minds and judgments in the world the machine epiktistes said ten humans and three machines. remember that there are thirteen of us. it might be important. regard the world said aloysius shiplap. i said that yesterday but it is required that i say it again. we have the world in our eyes and in our memories. if it changes in any way we will know it. push the button epikt said gregory smirnov. from his depths epiktistes the ktistec machine sent out an avatar partly of mechanical and partly of ghostly construction. and along about sundown  on the road from mende to avignon in the old languedoc district of france in the year 1323 john lutterell was stricken with one more sickness. he was taken to a little inn in the mountain country and perhaps he died there. he did not at any rate arrive at avignon.  did it work epikt is it done aloysius asked. lets look at the evidence said gregory. the four of them the three humans and the ghost epikt who was a kachenko mask with a speaking tube turned to the evidence with mounting disappointment. there is still the stick and the five notches in it said gregory. it was our test stick. nothing in the world is changed. the arts remain as they were said aloysius. our picture here on the stone on which we have worked for so many seasons is the same as it was. we have painted the bears black the buffalos red and the people blue. when we find a way to make another color we can represent birds also. i had hoped that our experiment might give us that other color. i had even dreamed that birds might appear in the picture on the rock before our very eyes. theres still rump of skunk to eat and nothing else said valery. i had hoped that our experiment would have changed it to haunch of deer. all is not lost said aloysius. we still have the hickory nuts. that was my last prayer before we began our experiment. dont let them take the hickory nuts away i prayed. i they sat around the conference table that was a large flat natural rock and cracked hickory nuts with stone fisthammers. they were nude in the crude and the world was as it had always been. they had hoped by magic to change it. epikt has failed us said gregory. we made his frame out of the best sticks and we plaited his face out of the finest weeds and grasses. we chanted him full of magic and placed all our special treasures in his cheek pouches. so what can the magic mask do for us now ask it ask it said valery. they were the four finest minds in the world the three humans gregory aloysius and valery the only humans in the world unless you count those in the other valleys and the ghost epikt a    kachenko mask with a speaking tube. what do we do now epikt gregory asked. then he went around behind epikt to the speaking tube. i remember a woman with a sausage stuck to her nose said epikt in the voice of gregory. is that any help it may be some help gregory said after he had once more taken his place at the flatrock conference table. it is from an old whats old about it i made it up myself this morning folk tale about the three wishes. let epikt tell it said valery. he does it so much better than you do. valery went behind epikt to the speaking tube and blew smoke through it from the huge loose blackleaf uncured stogie that she was smoking. the wife wastes one wish for a sausage said epikt in the voice of valery. a sausage is a piece of deermeat tied in a piece of a deers stomach. the husband is angry that the wife has wasted a wish since she could have wished for a whole deer and had many sausages. he gets so angry that he wishes the sausage might stick to her nose forever. it does and the woman wails and the man realized that he had used up the second wish. i forget the rest. you cant forget it epikt aloysius cried in alarm. the future of the world may depend on your remembering. here let me reason with that damned magic mask and aloysius went behind epikt to the speaking tube. oh yes now i remember epikt said in the voice of aloysius. the man used the third wish to get the sausage off his wifes nose. so things were the way they had been before. but we dont want it the way it was before valery howled. thats the way it is now rump of skunk to eat and me with nothing to wear but my ape cape. we want it better. we want deer skins and antelope skins. take me as a mystic or dont take me at all epikt signed off. even though the world has always been so yet we have intimations of other things gregory said. what folk hero was it who made the dart and of what did he make it willy mcgilly was the folk hero said epikt in the voice of valery who had barely got to the speaking tube in time and he made it out of slippery elm wood. could we make a dart like the folk hero willy made aloysius asked. we gotta said epikt. a  could we make a slinger and whip it out of our own context and into could we kill an avatar with it before he killed somebody else gregory asked excitedly. we sure will try said the ghost epikt who was nothing but a kachenko mask with a speaking tube. i never did like those avatars. you think epikt was nothing but a kachenko mask with a speaking tube there was a lot more to him than that. he had red garnet rocks inside him and real sea salt. he had powder made from beaver eyes. he had rattlesnake rattles and armadillo shields. he was the first ktistec machine. give me the word epikt aloysius cried a few moments later as he fitted the dart to the slinger. fling it get that avatar fink epikt howled. along about sundown in an unnumbered year on the road from nowhere to eom an avatar fell dead with a slippery elm dart in his heart. did it work epikt is it done charles cogsworth asked in excitement. it must have. im here. i wasnt in the last one. lets look at the evidence gregory suggested calmly. damn the evidence willy mcgilly cussed. remember where you heard it first. is it started yet glasser asked. is it finished audifax ohanlon questioned. push the button epikt diogenes barked. i think i missed part of it. lets try it again. oh no no valery forbade. not again. that way is rump of skunk and madness. in our block introduction by neil gaiman this was not the first short story of laffertys i read nor even the first i fell in love with. it was however the first story i ever took apart as best i could to try and work out how he did it. i would have been about eleven. i didnt know what an american city block actually wasit was an indeterminate word that meant simply a region as far as i was concerned. i came from towns and cities with winding random streets. but i loved the story. it was a shaggy dog story without a punch line a tall tale without apparent conflict in which all that happened was that two friends walked around a block and talked to people they found. a letter was dictated. it was about new people coming in about immigrants about people working hard and moving on. it was about taking the extraordinary for granted. and i loved the way the words worked. so i read it and i reread it and i read it aloud and i tried to understand it. i would never know what a dort glide was nor i suspected did lafferty but i felt that if i could understand how this short story was built and constructed i would understand how to write. i loved the way the people in the shanties spoke. i wanted to speak like the typist or her sister in the bar. i hoped one day to be able to say see how foxy i turn all your questions but i never had an opportunity to. i only had one tongue so to reply with my other tongue was also right out. coming back to it as an adult and i have read it every year or so i find that i love it as much as i ever did. its cockeyed and joyful but its also a glorious bluecollar lowrent story about a block in oklahoma where the people arriving just want to fit in. its about immigration and about what people bring to the places they visit. its about revealing secrets. and its a writers story too about the places that ideas come from. i imagine ray lafferty walking past a tin shack he had not noticed before on his way to a local bar and having a story in his head by the time that he returned home that night. in our block a there were a lot of funny people in that block. you ever walk down that street art slick asked jim boomer who had just come onto him there. not since i was a boy. after the overall factory burned down there was a faith healer had his tent pitched there one summer. the streets just one block long and it deadends on the railroad embankment. nothing but a bunch of shanties and weedfilled lots. the shanties looked different today though and there seem to be more of them. i thought they pulled them all down a few months ago. jim ive been watching that first little building for two hours. there was a tractortruck there this morning with a fortyfoot trailer and it loaded out of that little shanty. cartons about eight inches by eight inches by three feet came down that chute. they weighed about thirtyfive pounds each from the way the men handled them. jim they filled that trailer up with them and then pulled it off. whats wrong with that art jim i said they filled that trailer up. from the drag on it it had about a sixtythousandpound load when it pulled out. they loaded a carton every three and a half seconds for two hours thats two thousand cartons. sure lots of trailers run over the load limit nowadays they dont enforce a a it very well. jim that shacks no more than a cracker box seven feet on a side. half of it is taken up by a door and inside a man in a chair behind a small table. you couldnt get anything else in that half. the other half is taken up by whatever a a a a that chute comes out of. you could pack six of those little shacks on that trailer. lets measure it jim boomer said. maybe its bigger than it looks. the shack had a sign on it make sell ship anything cut price. jim boomer measured the building with an old steel tape. the shack was a sevenfoot cube and there were no hidden places. it was set up on a few piers of broken bricks and you could see under it. sell you a new fiftyfoot steel tape for a dollar said the man in the chair a in the little shack. throw that old one away. the man pulled a steel tape out of a drawer of his tabledesk though art slick was sure it had been a plain flattop table with no place for a drawer. fully retractable rhodiumplated dort glide ramsey swivel and it forms its own carrying case. one dollar the man said. jim boomer paid him a dollar for it. how many of them you got i can have a hundred thousand ready to load out in ten minutes the man said. eightyeight cents each in hundred thousand lots. was that a trailerload of steel tapes you shipped out this morning art asked the man. no that must have been something else. this is the first steel tape i ever made. just got the idea when i saw you measuring my shack with that old beatup one. art slick and jim boomer went to the rundown building next door. it was smaller about a sixfoot cube and the sign said public stenographer. the clatter of a typewriter was coming from it but the noise stopped when they opened the door. a dark pretty girl was sitting in a chair before a small table. there was nothing else in the room and no typewriter. i thought i heard a typewriter in here art said. oh that is me. the girl smiled. sometimes i amuse myself make typewriter noises like a public stenographer is supposed to. what would you do if someone came in to have some typing done what are you think i do it of course. could you type a letter for me sure is can man friend two bits a page good work carbon copy envelope and stamp. ah lets see how you do it. i will dictate to you while you type. you dictate first. then i write. no sense mix up two things at one time. art dictated a long and involved letter that he had been meaning to write for several days. he felt like a fool droning it to the girl as she filed her nails. why is public stenographer always sit filing her nails she asked as art droned. but i try to do it right file them down grow them out again then file them down some more. been doing it all morning. it seems silly. ahthat is all art said when he had finished dictating. not p.s. love and kisses the girl asked. hardly. its a business letter to a person i barely know. i always say p.s. love and kisses to persons i barely know the girl said. your letter will make three pages six bits. please you both step outside about ten seconds and i write it. cant do it when you watch. she pushed them out and closed the door. then there was silence. what are you doing in there girl art called. want i sell you a memory course too you forget already i type a letter the girl called. but i dont hear a typewriter going. what is you want verisimilitude too i should charge extra. there was a giggle and then the sound of very rapid typing for about five seconds. the girl opened the door and handed art the threepage letter. it was typed perfectly of course. there is something a little odd about this art said. oh the ungrammar of the letter is your own sir. should i have correct no. it is something else. tell me the truth girl how does the man next door ship out trailerloads of material from a building ten times too small to hold the stuff he cuts prices. well what are you people the man next door resembles you. my brotheruncle. we tell everybody we are innominee indians. there is no such tribe jim boomer said flatly. is there not then we will have to tell people we are something else. you got to admit it sounds like indian. whats the best indian to be shawnee said jim boomer. ok then we be shawnee indians. see how easy it is. were already taken boomer said. im a shawnee and i know every shawnee in town. hi cousin the girl cried and winked. thats from a joke i learn only the begin was different. see how foxy i turn all your questions. i have twobits coming out of my dollar art said. i know the girl said. i forgot for a minute what design is on the back of the twobitser piece so i stall while i remember it. yes the funny bird standing on the bundle of firewood. one moment till i finish it. here. she handed the quarter to art slick. and you tell everybody theres a smoothie public stenographer here who types letters good. without a typewriter said art slick. lets go jim. p.s. love and kisses the girl called after them. the cool man club was next door a small and shabby beer bar. the bar girl could have been a sister of the public stenographer. wed like a couple of buds but you dont seem to have a stock of anything art said. who needs stock the girl asked. here is beers. art would have believed that she brought them out of her sleeves but she had no sleeves. the beers were cold and good. girl do you know how the fellow on the corner can ship a whole trailer load of material out of a space that wouldnt hold a tenth of it art asked the girl. sure. he makes it and loads it out at the same time. that way it doesnt take up space like if he made it before time. but he has to make it out of something jim boomer cut in. no no the girl said. i study your language. i know words. out of something is to assemble not to make. he makes. this is funny. slick gaped. budweiser is misspelled on this bottle the i before the e. oh i goof the bar girl said. i couldnt remember which way it goes so i make it one way on one bottle and the other way on the other. yesterday a man ordered a bottle of progress beer and i spelled it progers on the bottle. sometimes i get things wrong. here i fix yours. she ran her hand over the label and then it was spelled correctly. but that thing is engraved and then reproduced slick protested. oh sure all fancy stuff like that the girl said. i got to be more careful. one time i forget and make jaxtaste beer in a schlitz bottle and the man didnt like it. i had to swish swish change the taste while i pretended to give him a different bottle. one time i forgot and produced a greenbottle beer in a brown bottle it is the light in here it just makes it look brown i told the man. hell we dont even have a light in here. i go swish fast and make the bottle green. its hard to keep from making mistake when youre stupid. no you dont have a light or a window in here and its light slick said. you dont have refrigeration. there are no power lines to any of the shanties in this block. how do you keep the beer cold yes is the beer not nice and cold notice how tricky i evade your question. will you good men have two more beers yes we will. and im interested in seeing where you get them slick said. oh look is snakes behind you the girl cried. oh how you startle and jump she laughed. its all joke. do you think i will have snakes in my nice bar but she had produced two more beers and the place was as bare as before. how long have you tumblebugs been in this block boomer asked. who keep track the girl said. people come and go. youre not from around here slick said. youre not from anywhere i know. where do you come from jupiter who wants jupiter the girl seemed indignant. do business with a bunch of insects there is all freeze your tail too. you wouldnt be a kidder would you girl slick asked. i sure do try hard. i learn a lot of jokes but i tell them all wrong yet. i get better though. i try to be the witty bar girl so people will come back. whats in the shanty next door toward the tracks my cousinsister said the girl. she set up shop just today. she grow any color hair on baldheaded men. i tell her shes crazy. no business. if they wanted hair they wouldnt be baldheaded in the first place. well can she grow hair on baldheaded men slick asked. oh sure. cant you there were three or four more shanty shops in the block. it didnt seem that there had been that many when the men went into the cool man club. i dont remember seeing this shack a few minutes ago boomer said to the man standing in front of the last shanty on the line. oh i just made it the man said. weathered boards rusty nails … and he had just made it. why didnt youahmake a decent building while you were at it slick asked. this is more inconspicuous the man said. who notices when an old building appears suddenly were new here and want to feel our way in before we attract attention. now im trying to figure out what to make. do you think there is a market for a luxury automobile to sell for a hundred dollars i suspect i would have to respect the local religious feeling when i make them though. what is that slick asked. ancestor worship. the old gas tank and fuel system still carried as vestiges after natural power is available. oh well ill put them in. ill have one done in about three minutes if you want to wait. no. ive already got a car slick said. lets go jim. that was the last shanty in the block so they turned back. i was just wondering what was down in this block where nobody ever goes slick said. theres a lot of odd corners in our town if you look them out. there are some queer guys in the shanties that were here before this bunch boomer said. some of them used to come up to the red rooster to drink. one of them could gobble like a turkey. one of them could roll one eye in one direction and the other eye the other way. they shoveled hulls at the cottonseed oil float before it burned down. they went by the public stenographer shack again. no kidding honey how do you type without a typewriter slick asked. typewriter is too slow the girl said. i asked how not why slick said. i know. is it not nifty the way i turn away a phrase i think i will have a big oak tree growing in front of my shop tomorrow for shade. either of you nice men have an acorn in your pocket ahno. how do you really do the typing girl you promise you wont tell anybody. i promise. i make the marks with my tongue the girl said. they started slowly on up the block. hey how do you make the carbon copies jim boomer called back. with my other tongue the girl said. there was another fortyfoot trailer loading out of the first shanty in the block. it was bundles of halfinch plumbers pipe coming out of the chutein twentyfoot lengths. twentyfoot rigid pipe out of a sevenfoot shed. i wonder how he can sell trailerloads of such stuff out of a little shack like that slick puzzled still not satisfied. like the girl says he cuts prices boomer said. lets go over to the red rooster and see if theres anything going on. there always were a lot of funny people in that block. when i wrote to r. a. lafferty as a very young man i asked him about his favorite of his own short stories. he mentioned three stories that i had read and lovedginny wrapped in the sun configuration of the north shore and continued on next rockand one that i hadnt. it was called ride a tin can. shortly afterward i bought a copy of strange doings and read ride a tin can and was disappointed. it made me sad. i think i wanted to be uplifted. i wanted the thing that lafferty did where his apocalypses were joyful things one went into with delight. and here were the shelni race going into an apocalypse with joyful delight and i walked away from the story feeling that i might just have read the saddest story in the world. i felt manipulated because it was an ending that called for tears told in a way that did not allow for tears. i did not trust tears anyway. ride a tin can left me disappointed in humanity. it was a story i could admire but i could not love and which i did not look forward to rereading. as an older reader i can love it i can love it for the shape of the story the three tiny tales that hover at the end of understanding i love it for the worldbuilding that is never fully described for the relationship between the shelni and the skokie and the frogs and the trees. i love it for holly harkel a human woman who is goblin enough to talk to goblins under their treeroot home goblin enough to ride a tin can herself. its a story nobody else could have written pulled off in a way nobody else would have imagined that describes a genocide that hurts without a word wasted. introduction by neil gaiman ride a tin can i think we are better than this. surely we must be better than this and i think how do you write a story like that anyway write a story like that and make it look easy but he does. somehow he does. its ok if you cry. these are my notes on the very sticky business. they are not in the form of a protest which would be useless. holly is gone and the shelni will all be gone in the next day or two if indeed there are any of them left now. this is for the record only. holly harkel and myself vincent vanhoosier received funds and permission to record the lore of the shelni through the intercession of that old correlator john holmberg. this was unexpected. all lorists have counted john as their worst enemy. after all we have been at great expense to record the minutiae of pig grunts and the sound of earthworms holmberg told me and we have records of squeakings of hundreds of species of orbital rodents. we have veritable libraries of the song and cackle of all birds and pseudoornins. well let us add the shelni to our list. i do not believe that their thumping on tree roots or blowing into jug gourds is music. i do not believe that their singsong is speech any more than the squeaking of doors is speech. we have recorded by the way the sound of more than thirty thousand squeaking doors. and we have had worse. let us have the shelni then if your hearts are set on it. youll have to hurry. theyre about gone. and let me say in all compassion that anyone who looks like miss holly harkel deserves her hearts desire. that is no more than simple justice. besides the bill will be footed by the singing pig breakfast food company. these companies are bitten by the small flea of remorse every now and then and they want to pitch a few coins into some fund for luck. its never many coins that they want to pitch the remorse bug that bites them is never a very ride a tin can large one. you may be able to stretch it to cover your project though vanhoosier. so we had our appropriation and our travel miss holly and myself. holly harkel had often been in disrepute for her claims to understand the languages of various creatures. there was special outrage to her claim that she would be able to understand the shelni. now that was odd. no disrepute attached to captain charbonnett for his claim to understand the planetary simians and if there was ever a phony claim it was this. no disrepute attached to meyrowitz for his claim of finding esoteric meanings in the patterns of vole droppings. but there seemed something incredible in the claim of the goblinfaced holly harkel that not only would she be able to understand the shelni instantly and completely but that they were not low scavenger beasts at all that they were genuine goblin people who played goblin music and sang goblin songs. holly harkel had a heart and soul too big for her dwarfish body and a brain too big for her curious little head. that i suppose is what made her so lumpy everywhere. she was entirely compounded of love and concern and laughter and much of it bulged out from her narrow form. her ugliness was one of the unusual things and i believe that she enjoyed giving it to the worlds. she had loved snakes and toads she had loved monkeys and misbegottens. she had come to look weirdly like them when we studied them. she was a snake when we studied them she was a toad when they were our subject. she studied every creature from the inside of it. and here there was an uncommon similarity even for her. holly loved the shelni instantly. she became a shelni and she hadnt far to go. she moved and scooted and climbed like a shelni. she came down trees headfirst like a shelni or a squirrel. she had always seemed to me to be a little other than human. and now she was avid to record the shelni things before they be gone. as for the shelni themselves some scientists have called them humanoid and then braced themselves for the blow and howl. if they were humanoid they were certainly the lowest and oddest humanoids ever. but we folklorists knew intuitively what they were. they were goblins pure and simplei do not use the adjectives here as cliché. the tallest of them were less than three feet tall the oldest of them were less than seven years old. they were perhaps the ugliest creatures in the universe and yet of a pleasant ugliness. there was no evil in them at all. scientists who have tested them have insisted that there was no intelligence in them at all. they were friendly and open. too friendly too open as it happened for they were fascinated by all human things to their harm. but they were no more human than a fairy or an ogre is human. less less less than a monkey. here is a den of them holly divined that first day it was the day before yesterday. there will be a whole coven of them down under here and the door is down through the roots of this tree. when i got my doctorate in primitive music i never imagined that i would be visiting brownies down under tree roots. i should say that i never so much as hoped that i would be. there was so much that they didnt teach us. there was even one period in my life when i ceased to believe in goblins. the latter i do not believe. suddenly holly was into a hole in the ground headfirst like a gopher like a ground squirrel like a shelni. i followed her letting myself down carefully and not headfirst. i myself would have to study the shelni from the outside. i myself would never be able to crawl inside their green goblin skins never be able to croak or carol with their frog tongues never feel what made their popeyes pop. i myself would not even have been able to sense out their dens. and at the bottom of the hole at the entrance to the den itself was an encounter which i disbelieved at the time i was seeing and hearing it. there occurred a conversation which i heard with my own ears they having become transcendent for the moment. it was in the frogcroak shelni talk between holly harkel and the fiveyearold ancient who guarded the coven and yet it was in a sort of english and i understood it knockle knockle. this from holly. crows in cockle. this from the guard. wogs and wollie. who you holly. whats a dinning coming inning. so they let us in. but if you think you can enter a shelni coven without first riming with the fiveyearold ancient who guards it then its plain that youve never been in one of the places. and though the philologists say that the speech of the shelni is meaningless croaking yet it was never meaningless to holly and in flashes it was not meaningless to me. the secret guess of holly was so. holly had insisted that the shelni spoke english within the limits of their vocal apparatus. and they told her at this very first session that they never had had any language of their own because no one had ever made one for us so they used english as soon as they came to hear it. we would pay you for the use of it if we had anything to pay you with they said. it is frog croak english but only the pure of ear can understand it. i started the recorder and holly started the shelni. quite soon she had them playing on those jugshaped flutes of theirs. frog music. ineffably sad sionnach skirries. rook crow and daw squabbling melody. they were pleasant weird little pieces of music that sounded as though they were played underwater. it would be hard to imagine them not played under the ground at least. the tunes were short just as all tunes of children are short. there was no real orchestration though that should have been possible with the seven flutes differently jugged and tuned. yet there was true melody in these short complete closed melody dwarfed perfection. they were underground fugues full of worms blood and cool as root cider. they were locust and chaffer and cricket din. then holly got one of the most ancient of the shelni to tell stories while the jug flutes chortled. here are the two of them that we recorded that first day. others who listen to them today say that there is nothing to them but croaking. but i heard them with holly harkel she helped interpret them to me so i can hear and understand them perfectly in frogcroak english. take them grisly posterity i am not sure that you deserve even this much of the shelni. the shelni who lost his burial tooth it is told this way. there was a shelni who lost his burial tooth before he died. every shelni begins life with six teeth and he loses one every year. then when he is very old and has only one tooth left he dies. he must give the last tooth to the skokie burialperson to pay for his burial. but this shelni had either lost two teeth in one year or else he had lived to too great an age. he died. and he had no tooth left to pay with. i will not bury you if you have no tooth left to pay me with said the skokie burialperson. should i work for nothing then i will bury myself said the dead shelni. you dont know how said the skokie burialperson. you dont know the places that are left. you will find that all the places are full. i have agreement that everybody should tell everybody that all the places are full so only the burialperson may bury. that is my job. nevertheless the dead shelni went to find a place to bury himself. he dug a little hole in the meadow but wherever he dug he found that it was already full of dead shelnis or skokies or frogs. and they always made him put all the dirt back that he had dug. he dug holes in the valley and it was the same thing. he dug holes on the hill and they told him that the hill was full too. so he went away crying for he could find no place to lie down. he asked the eanlaith whether he could stay in their tree. and they said no he could not. they would not let any dead folks live in their tree. he asked the eise if he could stay in their pond. and they said no he could not. they would not allow any dead folks in their pond. he asked the sionnach if he could sleep in their den. and they said no he could not. they liked him when he was alive but a dead person has hardly any friends at all. so the poor dead shelni wanders yet and can find no place to rest his head. he will wander forever unless he can find another burial tooth to pay with. they used to tell it so.   one comment on this burial story the shelni do have careful burial. but the burial crypts are plainly dug not by the sixfingered shelni but by the seven clawed skokie. there must be substance to the skokie burialperson. moreover the skokie though higher on the very low scale than the shelni do not bury their own. furthermore there are no shelni remains going back more than about thirty equivalent years. there are no random lying or fossil shelni at all though such remains are common for every other species here. the second story of the first day. the shelni who turned into a tree this is how they tell it. there was a woman who was neither shelni nor skokie nor frog. she was sky woman. one day she came with her child and sat down under the shelni tree. when she got up to go she left her own child who was asleep and picked up a shelni child by mistake. then the shelni woman came to get her own child and she looked at it. she did not know what was wrong but it was a sky people child. oh it has pink skin and flat eyes how can that be the shelni woman asked. but she took it home with her and it still lives with the shelni and everyone has forgotten the difference. nobody knows what the sky woman thought when she got the shelni child home and looked at it. nevertheless she kept it and it grew and was more handsome than any of them. but when the second year came and the young shelni was grown it walked in the woods and said i do not feel like a sky people. but if i am not a sky people then what am i i am not a duck. i am not a frog. and if i am a bird what kind of bird am i there is nothing left. it must be that i am a tree. there was reason for this. we shelni do look a little bit like trees and we feel a little bit like trees. so the shelni put down roots and grew bark and worked hard at being a tree. he underwent all the hardships that are the life of a tree. he was gnawed by goats and gobniu he was roughtongued by cattle and crom he was infested by slugs and befouled by the nameless animal. moreover parts of him were cut away for firewood. but he kept feeling the jug music creeping up all the way from his undertoes to his hair and he knew that this music was what he had always been looking for. it was the same jug and tine music that you hear even now. then a bird told the shelni that he was not really a tree but that it was too late for him to leave off growing like a tree. he had brothers and sisters and kindred living in the hole down under his roots the bird said and they would a have no home if he stopped being a tree. this is the tree that is the roof of our den where we are even now. this tree is our brother who was lost and who forgot that he was a shelni. this is the way it has always been told. on the second day it was remarkable how much holly had come to look like a shelni. and she was hardly taller than they were. ah well she has come to look like every sort of creature we have ever studied together. holly insists that the shelni have intelligence and i half agree with her. but the paragraph in the basic manual of this world is against us a tendency to attribute to the shelni an intelligence which they do not possess perhaps due to their fancied human resemblance. in mazerunning they are definitely inferior to the rodents. in the manipulation of latches and stops they are less adept than the earth raccoons or the asteroid rojon. in tool handling and true mimicry they are far from equal to the simians. in simple foraging and the instinct for survival they are far below the hog or the harzl. in mneme the necessary prelude to intelligence they are about on par with the turtles. their speech lacks the verisimilitude of the talking birds and their music is below that of the insects. they make poor watchdogs and inadequate scarecrows. it appears that the move to ban shelniphagi though perhaps sincere is illadvised. after all as an early spaceman put it what else are they good for well we have to admit that the shelni are not as intelligent as rats or hogs or harzls. yet i surely due to the influence of holly feel a stronger affinity to them than to rats or hogs or coons or crows or whatever. but no creature is so helpless as the shelni. how do they even get together the shelni have many sorts of songs but they do not have any romantic songs in our sense. after all they are small children till they die of old age. their sexual relationship seems distinguished either by total unawareness or by extreme bashfulness. i dont see how they bring it off at all vincent holly said the second day which was yesterday. they are here so they must have been born. but how do these bashful and scatterbrained threeyearolds ever get together to bring it off i cant find anything at all in their legends or acting patterns can you in their legends all their children are foundlings. they are born or discovered under a blueberry bush my translation of spionam. or alternately and in other cycles they are found under a quicken tree or in a cucumber patch. in common sense we must assume that the shelni are placental and viviparous. but should we apply common sense to goblin folk they also have a legend that they are fungoid and spring out of the ground at night like mushrooms. and that if a shelni woman wishes a child she must buy a fungoid slip from a skokie and plant it in the ground. then she will have her child ready the next morning. but holly was depressed yesterday morning. she had seen some copy by our sponsor the singing pig breakfast food company and it disturbed her singing pig the children love it nourishing novelty nursery rime characters in a can for your convenience real meat from real goblins no fat no bones. if your can has a lucky number tab you can receive free facsimile shelni jug flute. be the first on your block to serve singing pig the meat from real goblins. cornstarch and natural flavor added. oh well it was only an advertisement that they used back on world. we had our recording to do. vincent i dont know how they got here holly said but i know they wont be here very long. hurry hurry we have to get it down i will make them remembered somehow. holly got them to play on the tines that second day which was yesterday. there had been an impediment the day before she said. the tines may not be played for one until the second day of acquaintance. the shelni do not have stringed instruments. their place is taken by the tines the vibrating singing forks. they play these manypronged tuned forks like harps and in playing them they use the tree roots for sounding boards so that even the leaves in the air above partake a little of the music. the tines the forks are themselves of wood of a certain very hard but light wood that is sharp with chert and lime dust. they are wood i believe in an early stage of petrifaction. the tine fork music usually follows the jug flute music and the ballads that are sung to it have a dreamlike sadness of tone that belies the childish simplicity of the texts. a here are two more of those ballad stories that we recorded on the second day which was yesterday.  the skokie who lost his wife this is the way they tell it. a skokie heard a shelni jug flute jugging one night. that is the voice of my wife the skokie said. id know it anywhere. the skokie came over the moors to find his wife. he went down into the hole in the ground that his wifes voice was coming from. but all he found there was a shelni playing a jug flute. i am looking for my poor lost wife the skokie said. i have heard her voice just now coming out of this hole. where is she there is nobody here but myself the shelni said. i am sitting here alone playing my flute to the moons whose light runs down the walls of my hole. but i heard her here said the skokie and i want her back. how did she sound asked the shelni. like this and he jugged some jug music on his flute. yes that is my wife said the skokie. where have you hidden her that is her very voice. that is nobodys wife the shelni told the skokie. that is just a little tune that i made up. you play with my wifes voice so you must have swallowed my wife the skokie said. i will have to take you apart and see. if i swallowed anybodys wife im sorry said the shelni. go ahead then. so the skokie took the shelni apart and scattered the pieces all over the hole and some of them on the grass outside. but he could not find any part his wife. i have made a mistake said the skokie. who would have thought that one who had not swallowed my wife could make her voice on the flute it is all right said the shelni so long as you put me together again. i remember part of the way i go. if you remember the rest of the way then you can put me together again. but neither of them remembered very well the way the shelni was before of he was taken apart. the skokie put him together all wrong. there were not enough pieces for some parts and too many for others. let me help said a frog who was there. i remember where some of the parts go. besides i believe it was my own wife he swallowed. that was her voice on the flute. it was not a skokie voice. the frog helped and they all remembered what they could but it did not work. parts of the shelni could not be found again and some of the parts would not go into him at all. when they had him finished the shelni was in great pain and could hardly move and he didnt look much like a shelni. ive done all i can the skokie said. thats the way youll have to be. where is frog im inside said frog. thats where you will have to stay the skokie said. ive had enough of both of you. enough and these pieces left over. i will just take them with me. maybe i can make someone else out of them. that is the way the shelni still is put together all wrong. in his wrong form he walks the country by night being ashamed to go by day. some folks are startled when they meet him not knowing this story. he still plays his jug flute with the lost skokie wifes voice and with frogs voice. listen you can hear it now the shelni goes in sorrow and pain because nobody knows how to put him together right. the skokie never did find his lost wife. this is how it is told. and then there was the second story that we recorded yesterday the last story though we did not know it then that we would record of the shelni the singing pigs this is how they say it. we have the ancient story of the singing pigs who sing so loud that they fly up into the sky on the tail of their own singing. now we ourselves if we can sing loud enough if we can jug the flutes strong enough if we can tang the tines deep enough will get to be the singing pigs of our own story. many already have gone away as singing pigs. there come certain bell men with music carts. they play rangledangle sky music. they come for love of us. and if we can hurry fast enough when they come we can go with them we can ride a tin can over the sky. bong bong that is the bell man with the music cart now all the shelni hurry this is the day you may get to go. come all you shelni from the valley and the stream and jump on the cart for the free ride. come all the shelni from the meadows and the woods. come up from the tree roots and the holes underground. the skokie dont get to go the frogs dont get to go only the shelni get to go. cry if the cart is too full and you dont get to go today but dont cry too long. the bell men say that they will come back tomorrow and every day till there are no shelni left at all. come all you little singingpigshelni a bell man shouts. come get your free rides in the tin cans all the way to earth hey ben what other animal jumps onto the slaughter wagon when you only ring a bell come along little shelnipigs room for ten more on this wagon. thats all thats all. well have lots more wagons going tomorrow. well take all of you all of you hey ben did you ever see little pigs cry when theres no more room for them on the slaughter wagon these are the high kind words that a bell man speak for love of us. not even have to give a burial tooth or other tooth to pay for the ride. frogs cant go skokies cant go only the shelni get to go here are the wonderful things from the wagon the shelni get to go to one room where all their bones are taken out. this does never happen to shelni before. in another room the shelni are boiled down to only half their size little as little boy shelni. then they all get to play the game and crawl into the tin cans. and then they get their free ride in the tin cans all the way to earth. ride a tin can wipe off your sticky tears you who miss the music cart today. go to sleep early tonight and rise early tomorrow. sing your loudest tomorrow so the bell men will know where to come. jug the flutes very strong tomorrow tang the tines deep say whoop whoop here we are bell men. all laugh when they go with the bell men in the music cart. but there is story that someday a shelni woman will cry instead of laugh when they take her. what can be the matter with this woman that she will cry she will cry  out damn you its murder theyre almost people you cant take them theyre as much people as i am. double damn you you cant take me im human. i know i look as funny as they do but im human. oh oh oh this is the funniest thing of the story the prophecy thing part. oh oh oh the woman will say oh oh oh the jug flutes will echo it. what will be the matter with the shelni woman who cries instead of laughs this is our last story wherever it is told. when it is told for the last time then there will be no more stories here there will be no more shelni. who needs stories and jug flute music who can ride a tin can that is how it has been said. a   then we went out for the last time as it happened from the shelni burrow. and as always there was the riming with the fiveyearold ancient who guarded the place what to crowing got to going. jinx on jolly golly holly were it other bug my brother holly crying. sing her flying jugging shouting. going outing. now this was remarkable. holly harkel was crying when we came out of the burrow for the as it happened last time. she was crying great goblin tears. i almost expected them to be green.   today i keep thinking how amazingly the late holly harkel had finally come to look like the shelni. she was a shelni. it is all the same with me now she said this morning. would it be love if they should go and i should stay it is a sticky business. i tried to complain but those people were still ringing that bell and chanting all you little pigshelnisingers come jump on the cart. ride a tin can to earth hey ben look at them jump on the slaughter wagon it was inexcusable i said. surely you could tell a human from a shelni. not that one said a bell ringer. i tell you they all jumped on the wagon willingly even the funnylooking one who was crying. sure you can have her bones if you can tell which ones they are. i have hollys bones. that is all. there was never a creature like her. and now it is over with. a    but it is not over singing pig breakfast food company beware there will be vengeance it has been told. and the oldest of the oldest grandmothers knows how the universe began. or does she and does sheor theyknow how to live forever this is r. a. lafferty dangling a simple delicious carrot in front of his notsimple protagonist a space plunderer named ceran swicegood. of course ceran would like to think of himself as a special aspects man a more refined breed than his compatriots who take brutish names like manbreaker and barrelhouse. these names they feel make it easier for them to pillage. a name like ceran swicegood is for someone whos searching for more … esoteric and rarefied booty. but its this rarefied pretentious and ultimately greedy search that destroys poor ceran quicker than the shortterm cashmoney goals of his colleagues. knowledge is power but ultimate knowledge juuuuuuust out of reach is soulpoison. did i mention this story is also hilarious introduction by patton oswalt nine hundred grandmothers ceran swicegood was a promising young special aspects man. but like all special aspects he had one irritating habit. he was forever asking the question how did it all begin they all had tough names except ceran. manbreaker crag heave huckle blast berg george blood move manion when move says move you move trouble trent. they were supposed to be tough and they had taken tough names at the naming. only ceran kept his ownto the disgust of his commander manbreaker. nobody can be a hero with a name like ceran swicegood manbreaker would thunder. why dont you take storm shannon thats good. or gutboy barrelhouse or slash slagle or nevel knife you barely glanced at the suggested list. ill keep my own ceran always said and that is where he made his mistake. a new name will sometimes bring out a new personality. it had done so for george blood. though the hair on georges chest was a graft job yet that and his new name had turned him from a boy into a man. had ceran assumed the heroic name of gutboy barrelhouse he might have been capable of rousing endeavors and mansized angers rather than his tittering indecisions and flouncy furies. they were down on the big asteroid proavitusa sphere that almost tinkled with the potential profit that might be shaken out of it. and the tough men of the expedition knew their business. they signed big contracts on the nine hundred grandmothers a a native velvetlike bark scrolls and on their own parallel tapes. they impressed inveigled and somewhat cowed the slight people of proavitus. here was a solid twoway market enough to make them slaver. and there was a whole world of oddities that could lend themselves to the luxury trade. everybodys hit it big but you manbreaker crackled in kindly thunder to ceran after three days there. but even special aspects is supposed to pay its way. our charter compels us to carry one of your sort to give a cultural twist to the thing but it neednt be restricted to that. what we go out for every time ceran is to cut a big fat hog in the rumpwe make no secret of that. but if the hogs tail can be shown to have a cultural twist to it that will solve a requirement. and if that twist in the tail can turn us a profit then we become mighty happy about the whole thing. have you been able to find out anything about the living dolls for instance they might have both a cultural aspect and a market value. the living dolls seem a part of something much deeper ceran said. theres a whole complex of things to be unraveled. the key may be the statement of the proavitoi that they do not die. i think they die pretty young ceran. all those out and about are young and those i have met who do not leave their houses are only middling old. then where are their cemeteries likely they cremate the old folks when they die. where are the crematories they might just toss the ashes out or vaporize the entire remains. probably they have no reverence for ancestors. other evidence shows their entire culture to be based on an exaggerated reverence for ancestors. you find out ceran. youre special aspects man. ceran talked to nokoma his proavitoi counterpart as translator. both were expert and they could meet each halfway in talk. nokoma was likely feminine. there was a certain softness about both the sexes of the proavitoi but the men of the expedition believed that they had them straight now. do you mind if i ask some straight questions ceran greeted her today. sure is not. how else i learn the talk well but by talking some of the proavitoi say that they do not die nokoma. is this true how is not be true if they die they not be here to say they do not die. oh i joke i joke. no we do not die. it is a foolish alien custom which we see no reason to imitate. on proavitus only the low creatures die. none of you does why no. why should one want to be an exception in this but what do you do when you get very old we do less and less then. we come to a deficiency of energy. is it not the same with you of course. but where do you go when you become exceedingly old nowhere. we stay at home then. travel is for the young and those of the active years. lets try it from the other end ceran said. where are your father and mother nokoma out and about. they arent really old. and your grandfathers and grandmothers a few of them still get out. the older ones stay home. lets try it this way. how many grandmothers do you have nokoma i think i have nine hundred grandmothers in my house. oh i know that isnt many but we are the young branch of a family. some of our clan have very great numbers of ancestors in their houses. and all these ancestors are alive what else who would keep things not alive how would such be ancestors ceran began to hop around in his excitement. could i see them he twittered. it might not be wise for you to see the older of them nokoma cautioned. it could be an unsettling thing for strangers and we guard it. a few tens of them you can see of course. then it came to ceran that he might be onto what he had looked for all his life. he went into a panic of expectation. nokoma it would be finding the key he fluted. if none of you has ever died then your entire race would still be alive sure. is like you count fruit. you take none away you still have them all. but if the first of them are still alive then they might know their origin they would know how it began do they do you oh not i. i am too young for the ritual. but who knows doesnt someone know oh yes all the old ones know how it began. how old how many generations back from you till they know ten no more. when i have ten generations of children then i will also go to the ritual. the ritual. what is it once a year the old people go to the very old people. they wake them up and ask them how it all began. the very old people tell them the beginning. it is a high time. oh how they hottle and laugh then the very old people go back to sleep for another year. so it is passed down to the generations. that is the ritual. the proavitoi were not humanoid. still less were they monkeyfaces though that name was now set in the explorers lingo. they were upright and robed and swathed and were assumed to be twolegged under their garments. though as manbreaker said they might go on wheels for all we know. they had remarkable flowing hands that might be called everywhere digited. they could handle tools or employ their hands as if they were the most intricate tools. george blood was of the opinion that the proavitoi were always masked and that the men of the expedition had never seen their faces. he said that those apparent faces were ritual masks and that no part of the proavitoi had ever been seen by the men except for those remarkable hands which perhaps were their real faces. the men reacted with cruel hilarity when ceran tried to explain to them just what a great discovery he was verging on. little ceran is still on the howdiditbegin jag manbreaker jeered. ceran will you never give off asking which came first the chicken or the egg i will have that answer very soon ceran sang. i have the unique opportunity. when i find how the proavitoi began i may have the clue to  a  how everything began. all of the proavitoi are still alive the very first generation of them. it passes belief that you can be so simpleminded manbreaker moaned. they say that one has finally mellowed when he can suffer fools gracefully. by god i hope i never come to that. but two days later it was manbreaker who sought out ceran swicegood on nearly the same subject. manbreaker had been doing a little thinking and discovering of his own. you are special aspects man ceran he said and you have been running off after the wrong aspect. what is that it dont make a damn how it began. what is important is that it may not have to end. it is the beginning that i intend to discover said ceran. you fool cant you understand anything what do the proavitoi possess so uniquely that we dont know whether they have it by science or by fool luck ah their chemistry i suppose. sure. organic chemistry has come of age here. the proavitoi have every kind of nexus and inhibitor and stimulant. they can grow and shrink and telescope and prolong what they will. these creatures seem stupid to me it is as if they had these things by instinct. but they have them that is what is important. with these things we can become the patent medicine kings of the universes for the proavitoi do not travel or make many outside contacts. these things can do anything or undo anything. i suspect that the proavitoi can shrink cells and i suspect that they can do something else. no they couldnt shrink cells. it is you who talk nonsense now manbreaker. never mind. their things already make nonsense of conventional chemistry. with the pharmacopoeia that one could pick up here a man need never die. thats the stick horse youve been riding isnt it but youve been riding it backward with your head to the tail. the proavitoi say that they never die. they seem pretty sure that they dont. if they did they would be the first to know it as nokoma says. what have these creatures humor some. but ceran you dont understand how big this is. im the only one who understands it so far. it means that if the proavitoi have always been immortal as they maintain then the oldest of them are still alive. from them i may be able to learn how their speciesand perhaps every speciesbegan. manbreaker went into his dying buffalo act then. he tore his hair and nearly pulled out his ears by the roots. he stomped and pawed and went off bullbellowing it dont make a damn how it began you fool it might not have to end so loud that the hills echoed back it dont make a damnyou fool. ceran swicegood went to the house of nokoma but not with her on her invitation. he went without her when he knew that she was away from home. it was a sneaky thing to do but the men of the expedition were trained in sneakery. he would find out better without a mentor about the nine hundred grandmothers about the rumored living dolls. he would find out what the old people did do if they didnt die and find if they knew how they were first born. for his intrusion he counted on the innate politeness of the proavitoi. the house of nokoma of all the people was in the cluster on top of the large flat hill the acropolis of proavitus. they were earthen houses though finely done and they had the appearance of growing out of and being a part of the hill itself. ceran went up the winding ascending flagstone paths and entered the house which nokoma had once pointed out to him. he entered furtively and encountered one of the nine hundred grandmothersone with whom nobody need be furtive. the grandmother was seated and small and smiling at him. they talked without real difficulty though it was not as easy as with nokoma who could meet ceran halfway in his own language. at her call there came a grandfather who likewise smiled at ceran. these two ancients were somewhat smaller than the proavitoi of active years. they were kind and serene. there was an atmosphere about the scene that barely missed being an odornot unpleasant sleepy reminiscent of something almost sad. are there those here older than you ceran asked earnestly. so many so many who could know how many said the grandmother. she called in other grandmothers and grandfathers older and smaller than herself these no more than half the size of the active proavitoismall sleepy smiling. ceran knew now that the proavitoi were not masked. the older they were the more character and interest there was in their faces. it was only of the immature active proavitoi that there could have been a doubt. no masks could show such calm and smiling old age as this. the queer textured stuff was their real faces. so old and friendly so weak and sleepy there must have been a dozen generations of them there back to the oldest and smallest. how old are the oldest ceran asked the first grandmother. we say that all are the same age since all are perpetual the grandmother told him. it is not true that all are the same age but it is indelicate to ask how old. you do not know what a lobster is ceran said to them trembling but it is a creature that will boil happily if the water on him is heated slowly. he takes no alarm for he does not know at what point the heat is dangerous. it is that gradual here with me. i slide from one degree to another with you and my credulity is not alarmed. i am in danger of believing anything about you if it comes in small doses and it will. i believe that you are here and as you are for no other reason than that i see and touch you. well ill be boiled for a lobster then before i turn back from it. are there those here even older than the ones present the first grandmother motioned ceran to follow her. they went down a ramp through the floor into the older part of the house which must have been under ground. living dolls they were here in rows on the shelves and sitting in small chairs in their niches. dollsized indeed and several hundred of them. many had wakened at the intrusion. others came awake when spoken to or touched. they were incredibly ancient but they were cognizant in their glances and recognition. they smiled and stretched sleepily not as humans would but as very old puppies might. ceran spoke to them and they understood each other surprisingly. lobster lobster said ceran to himself the water has passed the danger point and it hardly feels different. if you believe your senses in this then you will be boiled alive in your credulity. a he knew now that the living dolls were real and that they were the living ancestors of the proavitoi. many of the little creatures began to fall asleep again. their waking moments were short but their sleeps seemed to be likewise. several of the living mummies woke a second time while ceran was still in the room woke refreshed from very short sleeps and were anxious to talk again. you are incredible ceran cried out and all the small and smaller and still smaller creatures smiled and laughed their assent. of course they were. all good creatures everywhere are incredible and were there ever so many assembled in one place but ceran was greedy. a roomful of miracles wasnt enough. i have to take this back as far as it will go he cried avidly. where are the even older ones there are older ones and yet older and again older said the first grandmother and thriceover older ones but perhaps it would be wise not to seek to be too wise. you have seen enough. the old people are sleepy. let us go up again. go up again out of this ceran would not. he saw passages and descending ramps down into the heart of the great hill itself. there were whole worlds of rooms about him and under his feet. ceran went on and down and who was to stop him not dolls and creatures much smaller than dolls. manbreaker had once called himself an old pirate who revelled in the stream of his riches. but ceran was the young alchemist who was about to find the stone itself. he walked down the ramps through centuries and millennia. the atmosphere he had noticed on the upper levels was a clear odor nowsleepy halfremembered smiling sad and quite strong. that is the way time smells. are there those here even older than you ceran asked a small grandmother whom he held in the palm of his hand. so old and so small that i could hold in my hand said the grandmother in what ceran knew from nokoma to be the older uncompounded form of the proavitus language. smaller and older the creatures had been getting as ceran went through the rooms. he was boiled lobster now for sure. he had to believe it all he saw and felt it. the wrensized grandmother talked and laughed and nodded that there were those far older than herself and in doing so she nodded herself back to sleep. ceran returned her to her niche in the hivelike wall where there were thousands of others miniaturized generations. of course he was not in the house of nokoma now. he was in the heart of the hill that underlay all the houses of proavitus and these were the ancestors of everybody on the asteroid. are there those here even older than you ceran asked a small grandmother whom he held on the tip of his finger. older and smaller she said but you come near the end. she was asleep and he put her back in her place. the older they were the more they slept. he was down to solid rock under the roots of the hill. he was into the passages that were cut out of that solid rock but they could not be many or deep. he had a sudden fear that the creatures would become so small that he could not see them or talk to them and so he would miss the secret of the beginning. but had not nokoma said that all the old people knew the secret of course. but he wanted to hear it from the oldest of them. he would have it now one way or the other. who is the oldest is this the end of it is this the beginning wake up wake up he called when he was sure he was in the lowest and oldest room. is it ritual asked some who woke up. smaller than mice they were no bigger than bees maybe older than both. it is a special ritual ceran told them. relate to me how it was in the beginning. what was that soundtoo slight too scattered to be a noise it was like a billion microbes laughing. it was the hilarity of little things waking up to a high time. who is the oldest of all ceran demanded for their laughter bothered him. who is the oldest and first i am the oldest the ultimate grandmother one said gaily. all the others are my children. are you also of my children  of course said ceran and the small laughter of unbelief flittered out from the whole multitude of them. then you must be the ultimate child for you are like no other. if you be then it is as funny at the end as it was in the beginning. how was it in the beginning ceran bleated. you are the first. do you know how you came to be oh yes yes laughed the ultimate grandmother and the hilarity of the small things became a real noise now. how did it begin demanded ceran and he was hopping and skipping about in his excitement. oh it was so funny a joke the way things began that you would not believe it chittered the grandmother. a joke a joke tell me the joke then. if a joke generated your species then tell me that cosmic joke. tell yourself tinkled the grandmother. you are a part of the joke if you are of my children. oh it is too funny to believe. how good to wake up and laugh and go to sleep again. blazing green frustration to be so close and to be balked by a giggling bee dont go to sleep again tell me at once how it began ceran shrilled and he had the ultimate grandmother between thumb and finger. this is not ritual the grandmother protested. ritual is that you guess what it was for three days and we laugh and say no no no it was something nine times as wild as that. guess some more. i will not guess for three days tell me at once or i will crush you ceran threatened in a quivering voice. i look at you you look at me i wonder if you will do it the ultimate grandmother said calmly. any of the tough men of the expedition would have done itwould have crushed her and then another and another and another of the creatures till the secret was told. if ceran had taken on a tough personality and a tough name hed have done it. if hed been gutboy barrelhouse hed have done it without a qualm. but ceran swicegood couldnt do it. tell me he pleaded in agony. all my life ive tried to find out how it began how anything began. and you know we know. oh it was so funny how it began. so joke so fool so clown so grotesque thing nobody could guess nobody could believe. tell me tell me ceran was ashen and hysterical. no no you are no child of mine chortled the ultimate grandmother. is too joke a joke to tell a stranger. we could not insult a stranger to tell so funny so unbelieve. strangers can die. shall i have it on conscience that a stranger died laughing tell me insult me let me die laughing but ceran nearly died crying from the frustration that ate him up as a million beesized things laughed and hooted and giggled oh it was so funny the way it began and they laughed. and laughed. and went on laughing … until ceran swicegood wept and laughed together and crept away and returned to the ship still laughing. on his next voyage he changed his name to blaze bolt and ruled for ninetyseven days as king of a sweet sea island in m81 but that is another and much more unpleasant story. i first encountered nine hundred grandmothers in the norton book of science fiction edited by ursula k. le guin and brian attebery with karen joy fowler an anthology that turned out to be important to my fiction writing career. it was published in fall 1993 during my first year in the graduate creativewriting program at north carolina state university. i dont think i bought a copy immediately but in january 1994 i had my first workshop with nebula award winner john kessel who peered at my manuscript and peered at me and peered at my manuscript again and said theres a long rich history of this sort of thing and youre part of it whether you know it or not. from that point kessel was my sensei and on his recommendation i snapped up a copy of the nortona box of marvels that tells a novice sf writer you can do anything you want as long as its strange. when i flew to the clarion west writers workshop that summer also on kessels recommendation the norton was one of the two inspirational hardcovers in my luggage. the other was faulkners absalom absalom for which i never will be asked to write an introduction. of all the stories in the norton that spoke directly to me nine hundred grandmothers may have spoken the loudest. in her norton essay le guin discusses science fictions tendency to literalize metaphors and laffertys afterword by andy duncan story precisely literalizes one of the foundational metaphors of my upbringing in rural south carolina where i was taught to venerate a long chain of ancestors growing ever smaller as they receded into the distance. their secrets were closely guarded but as i stumbled through the late twentieth century those generations were often audible in the background like peepers in the spring i was pretty sure they were laughing. moreover all my important ancestors the conveyors of culture and especially language seemed to be women. laffertys unforgettable living dolls of the planet proavitus latin for ancestral im told embody the famous faulkner line from requiem for a nun the past is never dead. its not even past. rereading laffertys story now i wonder about the fate of the proavitoi. what happens to them in the space between the storys last two sentences with the pharmacopoeia that one could pick up here a man need never die says manbreaker crag who envisions his team becoming the patent medicine kings of the universe. will these slight people survive manbreakers unstranding of their organic chemistry consider that lafferty was a lifelong resident of oklahomaa state wrested from the natives by any number of manbreaker cragsand many of his writings ponder the exploitation of the indigenous peoples of north america along with language itself it is the unavoidable theme of his great novel okla hannali. i believe lafferty knows exactly what happens to the proavitoi but spares us at the end by diverting our attention to another and much more unpleasant story. as the ultimate grandmother might have said was too joke a joke to tell a stranger perhaps lafferty could not insult a stranger to tell so funny so unbelieve. look out your window. what do you see the gang fight on the corner with the teenieboppers using churchkeys on each others faces the scissors grinder with his multicolored cart and tinkling bells a pudgy woman in a print dress too short for her fat legs hoeing her lawn a threealarm fire with children trapped on the fifth story a mad dog attached to the leg of a peddler of seventh day adventist literature an impending race riot with a representative of ram on a sound truck. any or all it takes no special powers of observation to catalog the unclassifiable. but now look again. what do you see what you usually see an empty street. now catalog curbstones without which cars would run up onto front lawns. mailboxes without which touch with the world would be diminished. telephone poles and wires without which communication would screech to a halt. gutters sewers and manholes without which you would be flooded when it rains. blacktop without which the car you own wouldnt last a month on the crushed rock. the breeze without which well a day is diminished. what are these things they are the obvious. so obvious they become invisible. how many water hydrants and mailboxes did you pass today none hardly. you passed dozens but you did not see them. they are the incredibly valuable absolutely necessary totally ignored staples of a wellrun community. speculative fiction is a small community. it has its obvious flashy residents. knight sheckley sturgeon bradbury clarke vonnegut. we see them and take note of them and know what theyre about. but the community would not run one thousandth as well as it does without the quiet writers the ones who turn out story after story not hack work but really introduction by harlan ellison™ land of the great horses excellent stories time after time. the kind you settle back and think about after finishing them saying that was a good story. and you promptly forget who wrote it. perhaps later you recall the story. oh yeah remember that one about… and then you wrinkle down and say what the hell was the name of the guy who wrote it hes done a bunch of things you know pretty fair writer… the problem is a matter of cumulativeness. each story is an excellence standing alone. but somehow it never makes a totality an image of a writer a career in perspective. this is the sad but obvious thing about r. a. laffertys place in speculative fiction. he is a man of substantiality whose writing is topflight. not merely competent fiction but genuinely exemplary fiction. he has been writing for how many years more than six but less than fifteen something like that. yet he is seldom mentioned when fans gather to discuss the writers. even though he has been anthologized many times been included in judith merrils years best sf on several occasions and the carrwollheim worlds best anthology twice and appeared in almost all the science fiction magazines. he is the invisible man. it will be rectified here. raphael aloysius lafferty will emerge will speak will declare himself and then you will read another extrabrilliant story by him. and dammit this time remember lafferty speaking i am not necessarily in this order fiftyone years old a bachelor an electrical engineer a fat man. born in iowa came to oklahoma when i was four years old and except for four years in the army have been here all my life. also one year on a little civil service job in washington d.c. the only college ive ever attended was a couple of years in the university of tulsas night school division long ago mostly math and german. ive spent close to thirty years working for electrical jobbers mostly as buyer and pricequotation man. during wwii i was stationed in texas north carolina florida california australia new guinea morotai dutch east indies now indonesia and the philippines. i was a good staff sergeant and at one time i could talk pretty fair pasar malay and tagalog of the philippines. what does a man say about himself never the important things. i was a heavy drinker for a few years and gave it up about six years ago. this left a gap when you give up the company of the more interesting drinkers you give up something of the colorful and fantastic. so i substituted writing science fiction. something i read in one of the writers magazines gave me the silly idea that science fiction would be easy to write. it isnt for me. i wasnt raised on the stuff like most of the writers in this form seem to have been. my hobby is language. any language. ive got at least a thousand dollars in selfteach grammars and readers and dictionaries and linguaphone and cortinaphone courses. ive picked up a rough reading knowledge of all the languages of the latin german and slavic families as well as irish and greek but actually spanish french and german are the only ones i read freely with respectable speed. im a catholic of the outofseason or conservative variety. as to politics i am the only member of the american centrist party whose tenets i will one day set out in an ironicutopia story. im a compulsive walker turn me loose in a strange town and ill explore every corner of it on foot inside a week. i dont think of myself as a very interesting fellow. this is the editor again for a final comment. lafferty is about as uninteresting as his stories. which is to say not at all. as entered for the prosecutions case against r. a.s contention that hes a neb the following story one of my particular favorites in this book. note the introduction above is reproduced from its original appearance in dangerous visions and is © 1967 the kilimanjaro corporation with the kind permission of the author. land of the great horses they came and took our country away from us the people had always said. but nobody understood them.  two englishmen richard rockwell and seruno smith were rolling in a terrain buggy over the thar desert. it was bleak red country more rock than sand. it looked as though the top had been stripped off it and the naked underland left uncovered. they heard thunder and it puzzled them. they looked at each other the blond rockwell and the dark smith. it never thundered in the whole country between new delhi and bahawalpur. what would this rainless north india desert have to thunder with lets ride the ridges here rockwell told smith and he sent the vehicle into a climb. it never rains here but once before i was caught in a draw in a country where it never rained. i nearly drowned. it thundered again heavy and rolling as though to tell them that they were hearing right. this draw is named kuti tavdavilittle river smith said darkly. i wonder why. then he jerked back as though startled at himself. rockwell why did i say that i never saw this draw before. how did a i name like that pop into my mind but its the low draw that would be a little river if it ever rained in this country. this land cant have significant rain. theres no high place to tip whatever moisture goes over. i wonder about that every time i come said rockwell and raised his hand toward the shimmering heightsthe land of the great horses the famous mirage. if it were really there it would tip the moisture. it would make a lush savanna of all this. they were mineral explorers doing ground minutiae on promising portions of an aerial survey. the trouble with the thar was that it had everything lead zinc antimony copper tin bauxitein barely submarginal amounts. nowhere would the thar pay off but everywhere it would almost pay. now it was lightning about the heights of the mirage and they had never seen that before. it had clouded and lowered. it was thundering in rolling waves and there was no mirage of sound. there is either a very large and very busy bird up there or this is rain rockwell said. and it had begun to rain softly but steadily. it was pleasant as they chukkered along in the vehicle through the afternoon. rain in the desert is always like a bonus. smith broke into a happy song in one of the northwest india tongues a tune with a ribald swing to it though rockwell didnt understand the words. it was full of double rhymes and vowelpacked words such as a child might make up how the devil do you know the tongues so well rockwell asked. i find them difficult and i have a good linguistic background. i didnt have to learn them smith said i just had to remember them. they all cluster around the boro jib itself. around the what how many of the languages do you know all of them. the seven sisters theyre called punjabi kashmiri gujarati marathi sindhi hindi. your seven sisters only number six rockwell jibed. theres a saying that the seventh sister ran off with a horse trader smith said. but that seventh lass is still encountered here and there around the world. often they stopped to survey on foot. the very color of the new rivulets was significant to the mineral men and this was the first time they had ever seen water flow in that country. they continued on fitfully and slowly and ate up a few muddy miles. rockwell gasped once and nearly fell off the vehicle. he had seen a total stranger riding beside him and it shook him. then he saw that it was smith as he had always been and he was dumbfounded by the illusion. and soon by something else. something is very wrong here rockwell said. something is very right here smith answered him and then broke into another song in an indian tongue. were lost rockwell worried out loud. we cant see any distance for the rain but there shouldnt be rising ground here. it isnt mapped. of course it is smith sang. its the jalo char. the what where did you get a name like that the maps a blank here and the country should be. then the map is defective. man its the sweetest valley in the world it will lead us all the way up. how could the map forget it how could we all forget it for so long smith whats wrong youre pieeyed. everythings right i tell you. i was reborn just a minute ago. its a coming home. smith were riding through green grass. i love it. i could crop it like a horse. that cliff smith it shouldnt be that close its part of the mir why sir that is lolo trusul. but its not real its not on any topography map map sir im a poor kalo man who wouldnt know about things like that. smith youre a qualified cartographer does seem that i followed a trade with a name like that. but the cliff is real enough. i climbed it in my boyhoodin my other boyhood. and that yonder sir is drapengoro rezthe grassy mountain. and the high plateau ahead of us which we begin to climb is diz boro graithe land of the great horses. rockwell stopped the terrain buggy and leaped off. smith followed him in a happy daze. smith youre wideeyed crazy rockwell gasped. and what am i were terribly lost somehow. smith look at the log chart and the bearings recorder log chart sir im a poor kalo man who wouldnt know  damn you smith you made these instruments. if theyre correct were seven hundred feet too high and have been climbing for ten miles into a highland thats supposed to be part of a mirage. these cliffs cant be here. we cant be here. smith but seruno smith had ambled off like a crazy man. smith where are you trotting off to cant you hear me you call to me sir asked smith. and by such a name are the two of us as crazy as the country rockwell moaned. ive worked with you for three years. isnt your name smith why yes sir i guess it might be englished as horsesmith or black smith. but my name is pettalangro and im going home. and the man who had been smith started on foot up to the land of the great horses. smith im getting on the buggy and im going back rockwell shouted. im scared liverless of this country that changes. when a mirage turns solid its time to quit. come along now well be back in bikaner by tomorrow morning. theres a doctor there and a whiskey bar. we need one of them. thank you sir but i must go up to my home smith sang out. it was kind of you to give me a ride along the way. im leaving you smith. one crazy man is better than two. ashava sarishan smith called a

pesos and told his wife to pack upthey were leaving. to leave now when business is so good she asked. i only got one car to fix and i cant fix that the man said. but if you keep it long enough he will pay you to put it together again even if it isnt fixed. thats what he did last time. and youve a horse to shoe. im afraid of that horse. it has come back though. lets go. are you sure we will be able to find it of course im not sure. we will go in our wagon and our sick horse will pull it. why will we go in the wagon when we have a car of sorts i dont know why. but we will go in the wagon and we will nail the old giant horseshoe up on the lintel board. a carny in nebraska lifted his head and smelled the air. its come back he said. i always knew wed know. any other romanies here i got a little

theres a catch. red put the papers for all the cars on the ground and put a brick on top of them. he got in the worst car on the lot and drove it off forever. all free he sang out as he drove off. pick up the papers and drive the cars away. theyre still there. you think people are crazy to fall for something like that that probably has a catch to it in galveston a barmaid named margaret was

presented several years ago he said that a little over a thousand years ago outer visitors came down to earth and took a sliver of our earth away with them. all of you found the proposition comical but i arrived at my conclusion by isostatic and eustatic analysis carried out minutely. there is no doubt that it happened. one of our slivers is missing said aloysius shiplap. you guessed the sliver taken at about ten thousand square miles in area and no more than a mile thick at its greatest. you said you thought they wanted to run this sliver from our earth through their laboratories as a sample. do you have something new on our missing sliver im closing the inquiry gregory said. theyve brought it back. it was simple really jekvasteskero gypsysimple. it is the gadjo the non gypsies of the world who give complicated answers to simple things. they came and took our country away from us the gypsies had always said and that is what had happened. the outer visitors had run a slip under it rocked it gently to rid it of nervous fauna and then taken it away for study. for a marker they left an immaterial simulacrum of that high country as we ourselves sometimes set name or picture tags to show where an object will be set later. this simulacrum was often seen by humans as a mirage. the outer visitors also set simulacra in the minds of the superior fauna that fled from the moving land. this would be a homing instinct inhibiting permanent settlement anywhere until the time should come for the resettlement entwined with this instinct were certain premonitions fortune showings and understandings. now the visitors brought the slice of land back and its old fauna homed in on it. what will theahpatronizing smile on my partouter visitors do now gregory aloysius shiplap asked back at the institute. why take another sliver of our earth to study i suppose aloysius gregory smirnov said.   lowintensity earthquakes rocked the los angeles area for three days. the entire area was

of unknown origin much given to wandering in automobiles. it is predicted that they will be the last users of this vehicle and several archaic chromeburdened models are still produced for their market. these people are not beggars many of them are of superior intelligence. they often set up in business usually as real estate dealers gamblers confidence men managers of mailorder diploma mills and promoters of one sort or other. they seldom remain long in one location. their pastimes are curious. they drive for hours and days on old and seldomused cloverleafs and freeways. it has been said that a majority of the angelenos are narcotics users but harold freelove who lived for some months as an angeleno has proved this false. what they inhale at their frolics smogcrocks is a black smoke of carbon and petroleum waste laced with monoxide. its purpose is not clear. the religion of the angelenos is a mixture of old cults with a very strong eschatological element. the paradise motif is represented by reference to a mystic sunset boulevard. the language of the angelenos is a colorful and racy argot. their account of their origin is vague they came and took our dizz away from us they say. afterword by gregory frost in 1967 harlan ellisons dangerous visions was first published by doubleday. i in high school in iowa and already devouring the likes of fredric brown bradbury heinlein asimov zelazny and dick might as well have been the target harlan put in the crosshairs. in retrospect we peer through many great annual best of anthologiesedited by gardner dozois david hartwell ellen datlow terri windling kelly link  gavin grant terry carr etc.and we forget how monumental was harlans lashing together of what he termed thirtytwo soothsayers. im near philadelphia now and so i think of harlan as the albert barnes of science fiction. barnes collection of impressionists is an extraordinary thing and to be fair there are a few disappointing works hanging among the matisses van goghs gaunguins picassos and renoirslesser paintings by artists who faded into obscurity though obviously barnes thought he saw something in them. dangerous visions really is the barnes collection of science fiction. a few what happened to... pieces but otherwise breathtaking. dangerous visions proved to be my gateway into the worlds of raphael aloysius lafferty through the story harlan selected called land of the great horses. i did not know at the time how extraordinary that would prove to be just as i didnt know that lafferty himself was a fellow lowan born in the southwestern town of neola iowaif anyone from neola is reading this you need to put up at least a plaque for heavens sake as lafferty stories go this one is short and seemingly simple but oh by the end it has shapeshifted on you more than once. it can be read in a way as a companion story to another tale of his called narrow valley also concerned with unreliable topography. it is also exemplary of the way lafferty entered stories sidewise producing a text that dives straight into a situation already in motion and seems to be about one thing yet turns out to be about something else. and then when you think you have its measure the author adds a punch line you never saw coming. here we begin with a sort of dictum they came and took our country away from us the people had always said. but nobody understood them. what country and what people we must read to discover. we are then introduced to two englishmen richard rockwell and seruno smith driving across the thar desert which is to say the great desert of india. they approach and behold a famous mirage called the land of the great horses or diz boro grai. its what theyve come to see. things immediately start to go wrong. in this extremely barren desert they hear the sound of thunder from an approaching storm and then find their mirage shot with lightning. the improbable climatic event seems to transform seruno smith he suddenly and inexplicably knows the names of places a draw called kuti tavdavi little river he bursts into song in tongues he does not speak. when asked how by rockwell he explains that he has only to remember these tongues to sing and that they all cluster around the boro jib itself. smith seems to be leading this great life out of nowhere. he confesses to rockwell that he speaks all languages in playthe socalled seven sisters but smith names only six. rockwell notices and finally requests the name of the missing language deep romany. rockwell tries to head back but smith refuses and calls him sarishan or english as if they are suddenly foreign to each other and then begins to scale the heights that until moments ago were part of the mirage. the story shifts then to various small scenes of people speaking various dialects of romani punjabi hindiin each its clear that someone with romany blood is feeling the pull of diz boro grai. some are romani rai gypsy gentlemen some are dukkerinwomen that is fortunetellers some perhaps athinganoi considered to be the ancestral tribe of the roma. and so it goes as various people with some percentage of gypsy blood pull up stakes and head home because the rez has riserd and it tugs at them smells like rain cannot be ignored. home is the land of great horses which became a mirage for thousands of years but now is no longer. to reveal more would be to spoil the story for the reader. suffice it to say that once you understand what is going on lafferty still has a coda to deliver one that plays on the diz of diz boro grai and dizz in a newly coined dialect that refers in all probability to disneyland. in narrow valley where michael swanwick tells me lafferty is having his little joke with the pawnee language here he effortlessly tosses off terms and phrases in various romany dialects ... all of which leads to a final a signature jape that can only exist because of his skill with those dialects. as so often happens in a story by r. a. lafferty you are turned and turned and turned again but always within the framework of the remarkable story itself. as a reader im agog. as a writer im forever asking how does he a do this euremas dam introduction by robert silverberg this is a story about a schlemiel to use a word probably not too often heard in raphael aloysius laffertys hometown of tulsa oklahoma. the schlemiel story is a genre i always thought id avoid if i were an editor for it has seemed to me that stories about schlemiels losers twerps dullards or schnooks would be of interest only to an audience of schlemiels losers twerps dullards or schnooks at best and no such people would be reading anything i edited. well never mind all that. r. a. lafferty was a cunning and tricky writer andas can quickly be seenthe schlemiel he created for us here is of an extraordinary sort. euremas dam won a hugo in 1973 at toronto. i am not all that awed by stories that win awards nor all that scornful of those that dont but laffertys feat of winning a hugo for euremas dam deserves some commemoration. virtually all hugowinning stories then were first published in science fiction magazines or in paperback anthologies easily available to a wide segment of the electorate but my anthology new dimensions ii had appeared only in an expensive hardcover edition that had sold perhaps six thousand copies. how given that handicap laffertys story had ever reached enough people to get the required number of votes i have no idea. yet it won beating out among other things a story of mine. i will not pretend that i would not have preferred it the other way around but i was undilutedly delighted that so fine and special a writer as lafferty had carried off his first trophy with a story i had published. euremas dam he was about the last of them. what the last of the great individualists the last of the true creative geniuses of the century the last of the sheer precursors no. no. he was the last of the dolts. kids were being born smarter all the time when he came along and they would be so forever more. he was about the last dumb kid ever born. even his mother had to admit that albert was a slow child. what else can you call a boy who doesnt begin to talk till he is four years old who wont learn to handle a spoon till he is six who cant operate a doorknob till he is eight what else can you say about one who put his shoes on the wrong feet and walked in pain and who had to be told to close his mouth after yawning some things would always be beyond himlike whether it was the big hand or the little hand of the clock that told the hours. but this wasnt something serious. he never did care what time it was. when about the middle of his ninth year albert made a breakthrough at telling his right hand from his left he did it by the most ridiculous set of mnemonics ever put together. it had to do with the way a dog turns around before lying down the direction of whirlpools and whirlwinds the side a cow is milked from and a horse is mounted from the direction of twist of oak and sycamore leaves the maze patterns of rock moss and of tree moss the cleavage of limestone the direction of a hawks wheeling of a shrikes hunting and of a snakes coiling remembering that the mountain boomer is an exception and that it isnt a true snake the lay of cedar fronds and of balsam fronds the twist of a hole dug by a skunk and by a badger remembering pungently that skunks sometimes use old badger holes. well albert finally learned to remember which was right and which was left but an observant boy would have learned his right hand from his left without all that nonsense. albert never learned to write a readable hand. to get by in school he cheated. from a bicycle speedometer a midget motor tiny eccentric cams and batteries stolen from his grandfathers hearing aid albert made a machine to write for him. it was small as a doodlebug and fitted onto a pen or pencil so that albert could conceal it with his fingers. it formed the letters beautifully as albert had set the cams to follow a copybook model. he triggered the different letters with keys no bigger than whiskers. sure it was crooked but what else can you do when youre too dumb to learn how to write passably albert couldnt figure at all. he had to make another machine to figure for him. it was a palmofthehand thing that would add and subtract and multiply and divide. the next year when he was in the ninth grade they gave him algebra and he had to devise a flipper to go on the end of his gadget to work quadratic and simultaneous equations. if it werent for such cheating albert wouldnt have gotten any marks at all in school. he had another difficulty when he came to his fifteenth year. people that is an understatement. there should be a stronger word than difficulty for it. albert was afraid of girls. what to do i will build me a machine that is not afraid of girls albert said. he set to work on it. he had it nearly finished when a thought came to him but no machine is afraid of girls. how will this help me his logic was at fault and analogy broke down. he did what he always did. he cheated. he took the programming rollers out of an old player piano in the attic found a gear case that would serve used magnetized sheets instead of perforated music rolls fed a copy of wormwoods logic into the matrix and he had a logic machine that would answer questions. whats the matter with me that im afraid of girls albert asked his logic machine. a nothing the matter with you the logic machine told him. its logical to be afraid of girls. they seem pretty spooky to me too. but what can i do about it wait for time and circumstances. they sure are slow. unless you want to cheat yes yes what then build a machine that looks just like you albert and talks just like you. only make it smarter than you are and not bashful. and ah albert theres a special thing youd better put into it in case things go wrong. ill whisper it to you. its dangerous.     so albert made little danny a dummy who looked like him and talked like him only he was smarter and not bashful. he filled little danny with quips from mad magazine and from quip and then they were set. albert and little danny went to call on alice. why hes wonderful alice said. why cant you be like that albert arent you wonderful little danny. why do you have to be so stupid albert when little danny is so wonderful i uh uh i dont know albert said uh uh uh. he sounds like a fish with the hiccups little danny said. a you do albert really you do alice screamed. why cant you say smart things like little danny does albert why are you so stupid this wasnt working out very well but albert kept on with it. he programmed little danny to play the ukulele and to sing. he wished that he could program himself to do it. alice loved everything about little danny but she paid no attention to albert. and one day albert had had enough. whawhawhat do we need with this dummy albert asked. i just made him to amto amuto make you laugh. lets go off and leave him. go off with you albert alice asked. but youre so stupid. i tell you what. lets you and me go off and leave albert little danny. we can have more fun without him. who needs him little danny asked. get lost buster. albert walked away from them. he was glad that hed taken his logic machines advice as to the special thing to be built into little danny. albert walked fifty steps. a hundred. far enough albert said and he pushed a button in his pocket. nobody but albert and his logic machine ever did know what that explosion was. tiny wheels out of little danny and small pieces of alice rained down a little later but there werent enough fragments for anyone to identify. albert had learned one lesson from his logic machine never make anything that you cant unmake.  well albert finally grew to be a man in years at least. he would always have something about him of a very awkward teenager. and yet he fought his own war against those who were teenagers in years and he defeated them completely. there was enmity between them forever. albert hadnt been a very welladjusted adolescent and he hated the memory of it. and nobody ever mistook him for an adjusted man. albert was too awkward to earn a living at an honest trade. he was reduced to peddling his little tricks and contrivances to shysters and promoters. but he did back into a sort of fame and he did become burdened with wealth. he was too stupid to handle his own monetary affairs but he built an actuary machine to do his investing and he became rich by accident. he built the damned thing too good and he regretted it. albert became one of that furtive group that has saddled us with all the mean things in our history. there was that punic who couldnt learn the rich variety of hieroglyphic characters and who devised the crippled short alphabet for wanwits. there was the nameless arab who couldnt count beyond ten and who set up the tennumber system for babies and idiots. there was the doubledutchman with his movable type who drove fine copy out of the world. albert was of their miserable company. albert himself wasnt much good for anything. but he had in himself the low knack for making machines that were good at everything. his machines did a few things. you remember that anciently there was smog in the cities. oh it could be drawn out of the air easily enough. all it took was a tickler. albert made a tickler machine. he would set it fresh every morning. it would clear the air in a circle three hundred yards around his hovel and gather a little over a ton of residue every twentyfour hours. this residue was rich in large polysyllabic molecules which one of his chemical machines could use. why cant you clear all the air the people asked him. this is as much of the stuff as clarence deoxyribonucleiconibus needs every day albert said. that was the name of this particular chemical machine. but we die of the smog the people said. have mercy on us. oh all right albert said. he turned it over to one of his reduplicating machines to make as many copies as were necessary. you remember that once there was a teenager problem you remember when those little buggers used to be mean albert got enough of them. there was something ungainly about them that reminded him too much of himself. he made a teenager of his own. it was rough. to the others it looked like one of themselves the ring in the left ear the dangling sidelocks the brass knucks and the long knife the guitar pluck to jab in an eye. but it was incomparably rougher than the human teenagers. it terrorized all in the neighborhood and made them behave and dress like real people. and there was one thing about the teenage machine that albert made it was made of such polarized metal and glass that it was invisible except to teenager eyes. why is your neighborhood different the people asked albert. why are there such good and polite teenagers in your neighborhood and such mean ones everywhere else its as though something had spooked all those right around here. oh i thought i was the only one who didnt like the regular kind albert said. oh no no the people answered him. if there is anything at all you can do about it so albert turned his mostly invisible teenager machine over to one of his reduplicating machines to make as many copies as were necessary and set one up in every neighborhood. from that day till this the teenagers have all been good and polite and a little bit frightened. but there is no evidence of what keeps them that way except an occasional eye dangling from the jab of an invisible guitar pluck. so the two most pressing problems of the latter part of the twentieth century were solved but accidentally and to the credit of no one. as the years went by albert felt his inferiority most when in the presence of his own machines particularly those in the form of men. albert just hadnt their urbanity or sparkle or wit. he was a clod beside them and they made him feel it. why not one of alberts devices sat in the presidents cabinet. one of them was on the high council of worldwatchers that kept the peace everywhere. one of them presided at riches unlimited that privatepublic international instrument that guaranteed reasonable riches to everyone in the world. one of them was the guiding hand in the health and longevity foundation which provided those things to everyone. why should not such splendid and successful machines look down on their shabby uncle who had made them im rich by a curious twist albert said to himself one day and honored through a mistake in circumstance. but there isnt a man or a machine in the world who is really my friend. a book here tells how to make friends but i cant do it that way. ill make one my own way. so albert set out to make a friend. he made poor charles a machine as stupid and awkward and inept as himself. now i will have a companion albert said but it didnt work. add two zeros together and you still have zero. poor charles was too much like albert to be good for anything. poor charles unable to think he made abut wait a moleskingloved minute here colonel this isnt going to work at allhe made a machi but isnt this the same blamed thing all over againhe made a machine to think for him and to hold it hold it thats enough. poor charles was the only machine that albert ever made that was dumb enough to do a thing like that. well whatever it was the machine that poor charles made was in control of the situation and of poor charles when albert came onto them accidentally. the machines machine the device that poor charles had a constructed to think for him was lecturing poor charles in a humiliating way. only the inept and deficient will invent that damned machines machine was droning. the greeks in their high period did not invent. they used neither adjunct power nor instrumentation. they used as intelligent men or machines will always use slaves. they did not descend to gadgets. they who did the difficult with ease did not seek the easier way. but the incompetent will invent. the insufficient will invent. the depraved will invent. and knaves will invent. albert in a seldom fit of anger killed them both. but he knew that the machine of his machine had spoken the truth. albert was very much cast down. a more intelligent man would have had a hunch as to what was wrong. albert had only a hunch that he was not very good at hunches and would never be. seeing no way out he fabricated a machine and named it hunchy. in most ways this was the worst machine he ever made. in building it he tried to express something of his unease for the future. it was an awkward thing in mind and mechanism a misfit. alberts more intelligent machines gathered around and hooted at him while he put it together. boy are you lost they taunted. that thing is a primitive to draw its power from the ambient we talked you into throwing that away twenty years ago and setting up coded power for all of us. uhsomeday there may be social disturbances and all centers of power seized albert stammered. but hunchy would be able to operate if the whole world were wiped smooth. it isnt even tuned to our information matrix they jibed. its worse than poor charles. that stupid thing practically starts from scratch. maybe therell be a new kind of itch for it said albert. its not even housebroken the urbane machines shouted their indignation. look at that some sort of primitive lubrication all over the floor. remembering my childhood i sympathize albert said. whats it good for they demanded. ahit gets hunches albert mumbled. duplication they shouted. thats all youre good for yourself and not very good at that. we suggest an election to replace you aspardon our laughterthe head of these enterprises. boss ive got a hunch how we can block them there the unfinished hunchy whispered. theyre bluffing albert whispered back. my first logic machine taught me never to make anything that i cant unmake. ive got them there and they know it. i wish i could think up things like that myself. maybe there will come an awkward time and i will be good for something hunchy said. only once and that rather late in life did a sort of honesty flare up in albert. he did one thing and it was a dismal failure on his own. that was the night of the year of the double millennium when albert was presented with the finnertyhochmann trophy the highest award that the intellectual world could give. albert was certainly an odd choice for it but it had been noticed that almost every basic invention for thirty years could be traced back to him or to the devices with which he had surrounded himself. you know the trophy. atop it was eurema the synthetic greek goddess of invention with arms spread as if she would take flight. below this was a stylized brain cut away to show the convoluted cortex. and below this was the coat of arms of the academicians ancient scholar rampant argent the anderson analyzer sinister gules the mondeman spacedrive dexter vair. it was a fine work by groben his ninth period. albert had a speech composed for him by his speechwriting machine but for some reason he did not use it. he went on his own and that was disaster. he got to his feet when he was introduced and he stuttered and spoke nonsense ahonly the sick oyster produces nacre he said and they all gaped at him. what sort of beginning for a speech was that or do i have the wrong creature albert asked weakly. eurema doesnt look like that albert gawked out and pointed suddenly at the trophy. no no that isnt her at all. eurema walks backward and is blind. and her mother is a brainless hulk. everybody was watching him with pained expression. nothing rises without a leaven albert tried to explain but the yeast is itself a fungus and a disease. you be regularizers all splendid and supreme but you cannot live without the irregulars. you will die and who will tell you that you are dead when there are no longer any deprived or insufficient who will invent what will you do when there are none of us defectives left who will leaven your lump then are you unwell the master of ceremonies asked him quietly. should you not make an end to it people will understand. of course im unwell. always have been albert said. what good would i be otherwise you set the ideal that all should be healthy and well adjusted. no no were we all well adjusted we would ossify and die. the world is kept healthy only by some of the unhealthy minds lurking in it. the first implement made by man was not a scraper or celt or stone knife. it was a crutch and it wasnt devised by a hale man. perhaps you should rest a functionary said in a low voice for this sort of rambling nonsense talk had never been heard at an awards dinner before. know you said albert that it is not the fine bulls and wonderful cattle who make the new paths. only a crippled calf makes a new path. in everything that survives there must be an element of the incongruous. hey you know the woman who said my husband is incongruous but i never liked washington in the summertime. everybody gazed at him in stupor. thats the first joke i ever made albert said lamely. my jokemaking machine makes them a lot better than i do. he paused and gaped and gulped a big breath. dolts he croaked out fiercely then. what will you do for dolts when the last of us is gone how will you survive without us albert had finished. he gaped and forgot to close his mouth. they led him back to his seat. his publicity machine explained that albert was tired from overwork and then that machine passed around copies of the speech that albert was supposed to have given. it had been an unfortunate episode. how noisome it is that the innovators are never great men and that the great men are never good for anything but just being great men. ورو your name  in that year decree went forth from caesar that a census of the whole country should be taken. the decree was from cesare panebianco the president of the country. it was the decimal year proper for the census and there was nothing unusual about the decree. certain provisions however were made for taking a census of the drifters and decrepits who were usually missed to examine them and to see why they were so. it was in the course of this that albert was picked up. if any man ever looked like a drifter and decrepit it was albert. albert was herded in with other derelicts set down at a table and asked tortuous questions. as what is he almost muffed that one but he rallied and answered albert. what time is it by that clock they had him in his old weak spot. which hand was which he gaped and didnt answer. can you read they asked him. not without my albert began. i dont have with me myno i cant read very well by myself. try. they gave him a paper to mark up with true and false questions. albert marked them all true believing that he would have half of them right. but they were all false. the regularized people are partial to falsehood. then they gave him a supplytheword test on proverbs. is the best policy didnt mean a thing to him. he couldnt remember the names of the companies that he had his own policies with. a in time saves nine contained more mathematics than albert could handle. there appear to be six unknowns he told himself and only one positive value nine. the equating verb saves is a vague one. i cannot solve this equation. i am not even sure that it is an equation. if only i had with me my but he hadnt any of his gadgets or machines with him. he was on his own. he left half a dozen other proverb fillins blank. then he saw a chance to recoup. nobody is so dumb as not to know one answer if enough questions 66 a 66 are asked. is the mother of invention it said. stupidity albert wrote in his weird ragged hand. then he sat back in triumph. i know that eurema and her mother he snickered. man how i do know them but they marked him wrong on that one too. he had missed every answer to every test. they began to fix him a ticket to a progressive booby hatch where he might learn to do something with his hands his head being hopeless. a couple of alberts urbane machines came down and got him out of it. they explained that while he was a drifter and a derelict yet he was a rich drifter and derelict and that he was even a man of some note. he doesnt look it but he really ispardon our laughtera man of some importance one of the fine machines explained. he has to be told to close his mouth after he has yawned but for all that he is the winner of the finnertyhochmann trophy. we will be responsible for him. albert was miserable as his fine machines took him out especially when they asked that he walk three or four steps behind them and not seem to be with them. they gave him some pretty rough banter and turned him into a squirming worm of a man. albert left them and went to a little hideout he kept. ill blow my crawfishing brains out he swore. the humiliation is more than i can bear. cant do it myself though. ill have to have it done. he set to work building a device in his hideout. what you doing boss hunchy asked him. i had a hunch youd come here and start building something. building a machine to blow my pumpkinpicking brains out albert shouted. im too yellow to do it myself. boss i got a hunch theres something better to do. lets have some fun. dont believe i know how to albert said thoughtfully. i built a fun machine once to do it for me. he had a real revel till he flew apart but he never seemed to do anything for me. this fun will be for you and me boss. consider the world spread out.  what is it its a world too fine for me to live in any longer albert said. everything and all the people are perfect and all alike. theyre at the top of the heap. theyve won it all and arranged it all neatly. theres no place for a clutterup like me in the world. so i get out. boss ive got a hunch that youre seeing it wrong. youve got better eyes than that. look again real canny at it. now what do you see  hunchy hunchy is that possible is that really what it is i wonder why i never noticed it before. thats the way of it though now that i look closer. six billion patsies waiting to be took six billion patsies without a defense of any kind a couple of guys out for some fun man they could mow them down like fields of albertimproved concho wheat boss ive got a hunch that this is what i was made for. the world sure had been getting stuffy. lets tie into it and eat off the top layer. man we can cut a swath. well inaugurate a new era albert gloated. well call it the turning of the worm. well have fun hunchy. well gobble them up like goobers. how come i never saw it like that before six billion patsies the twentyfirst century began on this rather odd note. i live in the future. in 1978 when selenium ghosts of the eighteen seventies was first published i was ten years old. my family lived in the forestfireprone foothills of the canadian rockies in the echo path of wolf howls and coyote yips. that close to the mountains radio signals arent reliable. aside from the telephone our only connection to the outside world was the tv. and oh boy did we love it. we had one channel the canadian broadcasting corporation. the cbcs programming wasnt particularly inspiringmostly homegrown shows like the beachcombers and front page challenge with a few american shows like m.a.s.h. scattered like jewels across prime time. we were always disappointed when the shows went into repeats because we had no alternative. but we were kids. we would watch anything. my brother earned the nickname patternwatcher because when the channel got knocked off the air he would literally stare at the static pattern. i would too from time to time. occasionally if i stared long enough id see things in there. selenium ghosts of the eighteen seventies is an alternate history of television. the narrator is an unnamed historian probably amateur who describes the television shows produced by aurelian bentley in 1873. these selenium slow light dramas are transmitted to television receivers that will repeat anything they receive. thrillingly because of the quirks of slow light introduction by kelly robson selenium ghosts of the eighteen seventies the more the receivers repeat the dramas the better they become. they evolve and grow. the picture becomes clearer. the oncesilent productions begin to develop sound. they also develop metacommentary breaking the fourth wall and letting us into the inner workings of the wonderful world of aurelian bentley. what a thrilling science fictional concept. my brothers and sisters and i would have embraced this technology in 1978. we would have watched those slow light dramas until they became so real we could have walked into their world. this is lafferty at his most delightful playing with words and images to build a multilayered story within a story within a story that seems real despite its stylized melodramatic trappings. i try to forgive lafferty the use of troubling racial epithets should i even though they throw me out of the story in 1978 no there was no excuse because he touches my world to his. lafferty makes me remember my entertainmentstarved youth where we would have done anything for a tv show that changed and even got better in repeat. and he makes me appreciate anew the wonder of this future i live in where i carry in my pocket a receiver that will bring me at a moments notice all the television anyone could ever want. even today the invention of television is usually ascribed to paul nipkow of germany and the year is given as 1884. nipkow used the principle of the variation in the electrical conductivity of selenium when exposed to light and he used scanning discs as mechanical effectors. what else was there for him to use before the development of the phototube and the currentamplifying electron tube the resolution of nipkows television was very poor due to the slow light characteristics of selenium response and the lack of amplification. there were however several men in the united states who transmitted a sort of television before nipkow did so in germany. resolution of the images of these even earlier experimenters in the field aurelian bentley jessy polk samuel j. perry gifford hudgeons was even poorer than was the case with nipkow. indeed none of these prenipkow inventors in the television field is worthy of much attention except bentley. and the interest in bentley is in the content of his transmissions and not in his technical ineptitude. it is not our object to enter into the argument of who really did first invent television it was not paul nipkow and it probably was not aurelian bentley or jessy polk either our object is to examine some of the earliest true television dramas in their own queer slow light context. and the first of those slow light or selenium moonshine dramas were put together by aurelian bentley in the year 1873. the earliest art in a new field is always the freshest and is often the best. selenium ghosts of the eighteen seventies homer composed the first and freshest and probably the best epic poetry. whatever caveman did the first painting it remains among the freshest as well as the best paintings ever done. aeschylus composed the first and best tragic dramas euclid invented the first and best of the artful mathematics we speak here of mathematics as an art without being concerned with its accuracy or practicality. and it may be that aurelian bentley produced the best of all television dramas in spite of their primitive aspect. bentleys television enterprise was not very successful despite his fee of one thousand dollars per day for each subscriber. in his heyday or his hey month november of 1873 bentley had fiftynine subscribers in new york city seventeen in boston fourteen in philadelphia and one in hoboken. this gave him an income of ninetyone thousand dollars a day which would be the equivalent of about a million dollars a day in todays terms but bentley was extravagant and prodigal and he always insisted that he had expenses that the world wotted not of. in any case bentley was broke and out of business by the beginning of the year 1874. he was also dead by that time. the only things surviving from the wonderful world of aurelian bentley are thirteen of the slow light dramas the master projector and nineteen of the old television receivers. there are probably others of the receivers around somewhere and persons coming onto them might not know what they are for. they do not look much like the television sets of later years. the one we use for playing the old dramas is a good kerosenepowered model which we found and bought for eighteen dollars two years ago. if the old sets are ever properly identified and become collectors items the price on them may double or even triple. we told the owner of the antique that it was a chestnut roaster and with a proper rack installed it could likely be made to serve as that. we bought the master projector for twentysix dollars. we told the owner of that monster that it was a chicken incubator. the thirteen dramas in their canisters we had for thirtynine dollars total. we had to add formaldehyde to activate the dramas however and we had to add it to both the projector and the receiver the formaldehyde itself came to fiftytwo dollars. i discovered soon that the canisters with their dramas were not really needed nor was the master projector. the receiver itself would repeat everything that it had ever received. still and all it was money well spent. the kerosene burner activated a small dynamo that imposed an electrical grid on the selenium matrix and awakened the memories of the dramas. there was however an oddity in all the playbacks. the filmfix of the receiver continued to receive impressions so that every time a slow light drama is presented it is different because of the feedback. the resolution of the pictures improves with use and is now much clearer and more enjoyable than originally. the librettos of the first twelve of the thirteen bentley dramas are not good not nearly as good as the librettos of the jessy polk and the samuel j. perry dramas later in the decade. aurelian bentley was not a literary man he was not even a completely literate man. his genius had many gaping holes in it. but he was a passionately dramatic man and these dramas which he himself devised and directed have a great sweep and action to them. and even the librettos from which he worked are valuable for one reason. they tell us though sometimes rather ineptly and vaguely what the dramas themselves are all about. without these outlines we would have no idea in the world of the meaning of the powerful dramas. there was an unreality a ghostliness about all the dramas as though they were made by sewer light underground or as if they were made by poor quality moonlight. remember that the element selenium the metal that is not a metal the chemical basis of the dramas is named from selene the moon. bentley did not use moving pictures of quickly succeeding frames to capture and transmit his live presentation dramas. although muybridge was in fact working on the zoopraxiscope the first moving picture device at that very time his still incomplete work was not known to aurelian bentley. samuel j. perry and gifford hudgeons did use moving picture techniques for their primitive television dramas later in the decade but bentley fortunately perhaps did not. each of bentleys thirtyminute live dramas however it appeared for the first time in the first television receiver was recorded in one single matrix or frame and thereafter that picture took on a life and growth of its own. it was to some extent independent of sequence an effect that has been attempted and failed of in several of the other arts and it had a free way with time and space generally. this is part of the ghostliness of the dramas and it is a large part of their power and charm. each drama was one evolving moment outside of time and space though mostly the scenes were in new york city and the barrens of new jersey. of course there was no sound in these early bentley dramas but let us not go too far astray with that particular of course. slow sound as well as slow light is a characteristic of selenium response and we will soon see that sound did in fact creep into some of the dramas after much replaying. whether their total effects were accidental or by design these early television dramas were absolutely unique. the thirteen slow light dramas produced by aurelian bentley in the year 1873 the thirteenth of them the mysterious pettifoggers of philadelphia lacks bentleys seal of production and indeed it was done after his death and yet he appears as a major character in it were these 1. the perils of patience a damnable chase. in this clarinda calliope who was possibly one of the greatest actresses of american or world drama played the part of patience palmer in the title role. leslie whitemansion played the role of simon legree. kirbac fouet played the part of the whip a sinister character. x. paul mccoffin played the role of the embalmer. jaime del diablo played the jesuit one of the most menacing roles in all drama. torres malgre played the slaver who carried the forged certificate showing that patience had a shadow of black blood and so might be returned to slavery on san croix. inspiro spectralski played the panther is he a man is he a ghost who is the embodiment of an evil that is perhaps from beyond the world. hubert saint nicholas played the part of the guardian who is really a false guardian. this damnable chase is really a galloping allegory. it is the allegory of good against evil of light against darkness of inventiveness against crude obtuseness of life against death of openness against intrigue of love against hatred of courage against hellish fear. for excitement and intensity this drama has hardly an equal. time and again it seemed that the embalmer striking out of the dark would stab patience with his needle full of the dread embalming fluid and so trap her in the rigidity of living death. time and again it seemed that the whip would cut the flesh of patience palmer with his long lash with viper poison on its iron tip that would bring instant death. at every eventuality it seemed as though simon legree or the slaver would enslave her body or the jesuit or the panther would enslave her soul. and her mysterious guardian seems always about to save her but his every attempt to save her has such reverse and disastrous effects as to cast doubt on the honesty and sincerity of the guardian. a high point of the drama is the duel of the locomotives that takes place during a tempestuous night in the west orange switching yards. again and again patience palmer is all but trapped on railroad trestles by thundering locomotives driven by her adversaries the west orange switching yards seem to consist almost entirely of very high railroad trestles. patience finally gets control of a locomotive of her own on which to escape but the locomotives of her enemies thunder at her from every direction so that she is able to switch out of their way only at the last brink of every moment. the embalmer attempts to stab her with his needleful of embalming fluid every time their locomotives pass each other with double thunder and only inches to spare. the whip tries to lash her with his cruel lash with its poisoned tip and the slaver threatens her with the outreached forged certificate of color and only by fantastic cringing can she cringe back far enough to keep from being touched by it as their locomotives roar past each other in opposite directions. it seems impossible that the racing locomotives can come so close and not hit each other with their dazzling switching from track to track. and then oh god save us all the panther is he a man is he a devil has leaped from his own locomotive to that of patience palmer he is behind her on her own locomotive and she does not see him. he comes closerbut the climax of the perils of patience is not there in the west orange switching yards. it is at a secret town and castle in the barrens of new jersey a castle of evil repute. in this place the enemies of patience were assembling a gang of beaters slackfaced fellows with their tongues cut out and they were readying bloodhounds to hunt patience down to her death. she somehow obtains a large wagon piled high with hay and pulled by six large high spirited horses. with this she boldly drives on a stormy night into the secret town of her enemies and down that jagged road there was a lightning storm going on that made everything seem jagged at the end of which was the castle itself. the bloodhounds leap high at her as she passes but they cannot pull her from the wagon. but the panther is he a man is he a beast has leaped onto her hay wagon behind her and she does not see him. he comes close behind herbut patience palmer is already making her move. driving unswervingly carrying out her own intrepid plan at that very moment she raises a key in her hand very high into the air. this draws the lightning down with a stunning flash and the hay wagon is set ablaze. patience leaps clear of the flaming hay wagon at the last possible moment and the blazing hurtling inferno crashes into the tall and evil castle to set it and its outbuildings and its whole town ablaze. this is the flaming climax to one of the greatest chase dramas ever. this final scene of the perils will be met with often later. due to the character of the slow light or selenium scenes this vivid scene leaks out of its own framework and is superimposed sometimes faintly sometimes powerfully as a ghost scene on all twelve of the subsequent dramas. 2. thirsty daggers a murder mystery. this is the second of the aurelian bentley television dramas of 1873. clarinda calliope one of the most talented actresses of her time played the part of maud trenchant the girl detective. the actors leslie whitemansion kirbac fouet x. paul mccoffin jaime del diablo torres malgre inspiro spectralski and hubert saint nicholas played powerful and menacing roles but their identities and purposes cannot be set exactly. one must enter into the bloody and thrilling spirit of the drama without knowing the details. more even than the perils of patience does thirsty daggers seem to be freed from the bonds of time and sequence. it is all one unfolding moment growing always in intensity and intricacy but not following a straight line of action. and this accompanied by a deficiency of the libretto leads to confusion. the libretto cannot be read. it is darkened and stained. chemical analysis has revealed that it is stained with human blood. it is our belief that bentley sent the librettos to his clients decorated with fresh human blood to set a mood. but time has spread the stains and almost nothing can be read. this is however a highly interesting drama the earliest murder ever done for television. it is nearly certain that maud trenchant the girl detective overcomes all the menaces and solves all the crimes but the finer details of this are lost forever. 3. the great bicycle race the third of the bentley television dramas has that versatile actress clarinda calliope playing the lead role of july meadowbloom in this joyful and allegorical journey into summertime. it is in the great bicycle race that sound makes its first appearance in the bentley dramas. it is the sounds of all outdoors that are heard in this drama faintly at first and more and more as time goes on. these are country and village sounds they are county fair sounds. though the sounds seem to be an accidental intrusion another ghostly sideplay of the selenium response magic yet their quality lends belief to the evidence that the full and original title of this drama was the great bicycle race a pastoral. but there are other sounds sometimes angry sometimes imploring sometimes arrogant and menacingmore about them in a bit. sheep and cattle sounds are all through the play goat and horse and swine sounds the rattle of ducks and geese all the wonderful noises of the countryside. there are birds and grasshoppers windmills and wagons people calling and singing. there are the sounds of carnival barkers and the chants of gamblers and shills. there are the shrieks and giggles of young people. and then there are those intrusive sounds of another sort the separate overlay. these seem to be mostly indoor sounds but sometimes they are outdoor grandstand sounds also bristling talk in the reserved shadows of crowd noise and roaring. no no no. ill not be had. what sort of a girl do you think i am all these things i will give you clarie. no one else would give you so much. no one else would ever care so much. but now is the time for it. now is the summer of our lives. now we cut hay. lets just see the price of a good hay barn first aurie. lets just get some things down on paper right now. we are talking about a summertime check that is as big as all summer. and we are talking about a much larger settlement to back up the other seasons and years. dont you trust me clarie of course i trust you bentley baby. i trust that you will get that trust fund that we are talking about down on paper today. i am a very trusting woman. i believe that we should have a trust fund to cover every condition and circumstance. odd talk that to be mixed in with the sound of the great bicycle race. the race was in conjunction with the tricounty fair which counties were camden gloucester and atlantic. the bicycle racers rode their twentymile course every afternoon for five afternoons and careful time was kept. there was betting on each days race but there was bigger betting on the final winner with the lowest total time for the five days and the kitty grew and grew. from the great fairground grandstand one could see almost all of the twentymile course that the riders rode or could follow it by the plumes of dust. the grandstand was on high ground and the whole countryside was spread out before it. cattle and mules were paraded and judged in front of that grandstand before and during and after that daily race then the race for the approximate hour that it took to run it was the big thing. there were seven drivers in the race and all of them were world famous 1. leslie whitemansion drove on a von sauerbronn special of fine german craftsmanship. this machine popularly known then as the whizzer would get you there and it would bring you back. it was very roadworthy and surprisingly fast. 2. kirbac fouet was on an ernest michaux magicien a splendid machine. it had a socket into which a small sail might be fitted to give greater speed on a favorable wind. 3. x. paul mccoffin was on a british royal velocipede. there are two things that may be remarked about the british royal it had solid rubber tires the first rubbertired bicycle ever and it had class. it had that cluttered austerity of line that only the best of british products have. 4. jaime del diablo was on a pierre lallement boneshaker with its iron tired wooden wheels the front one much larger than the rear. 5. torres malgre was on an americanbuilt richard warren sears roadrunner the first alliron machine. the only wood is in the heads of its detractors was an advertising slogan used for the roadrunner. 6. inspiro spectralski is he a man is he a cannon ball was riding a mccrackens comet. this comet had won races at several other county fairs around the state. 7. hubert saint nicholas had a machine such as no one in the state had ever seen before. it was a french bicyclette named the supreme. the bicyclette had the pedals fixed to drive the back wheel by the ingenious use of a chain and sprocket wheel and so was not strictly speaking a bicycle at all. the true bicycles of the other six racers had the pedals attached directly to the front wheels. there was one syndicate of bettors who said the bicyclette had a mechanical advantage and that hubert would win on it. but other persons made jokes about this rig whose back wheel would arrive before its front wheel and whose driver would not arrive before the next day. it was on these great riders that all the sixshot gamblers around were wagering breathtaking sums. it was for them that sports came from as far away as new york city. clarinda calliope played the role of gloria goldenfield the beauty queen of the tricounty fair in this drama. but she also played the role of the masked alternate rider number seven. all the racing riders had their alternates to ride in their places in case of emergency. and clarinda also played a third role that of rakesly rivertown the splurging gambler. who would ever guess that the raffish rakesly was being played by a woman the author and director of the great bicycle race did not know anything about clarinda playing these latter two roles. the grandstand the bandstand the pleasures of a country carnival in the summertime and the slow smells of the seleniumdirected matrix just becoming ripe and evocative now smell of sweet clover and timothy hay or hot horses pulling buggies or working in the fields smells of candy and sausage and summer squash at the eating places at the fair smells of dusty roads and of green money being counted out and thumped down on betting tables for the bicycle race and then again there was the override of intrusive voices breaking in on the real summer drama just by accident. clarie i will do handsomely by you in just a day or so. i have placed very very heavy bets on the bicycle race and i will win. i am betting against the wildest gambler in this part of the country rakesly rivertown and we will have the bet up to cool million with one more raise. he is betting the field against number seven. and number seven will win. i have heard that this rakesly rivertown is about the sharpest gambler anywhere and that he has a fine figure and makes an extraordinary appearance. a fine figure why the fraud is shaped like a girl yes he is a sharp gambler but he doesnt understand mechanics. number seven the supreme has a rearwheel drive with gearratio advantage. hubert saint nicholas who is riding number seven is just toying with the other riders so far to get the bets higher and he can win whenever he wants to. i will win a million dollars on the race my love. and i will give it to you if you act a little bit more like my love. surely your love for me should transcend any results of a bicycle race aurie. if you really loved me and if you contemplated making such a gift to me you would make it today. that would show that your appreciation and affection are above mere fortune. and if you cant lose as you say that you cannot you will have your money in the same amount won back in two days time and you will have made me happy two days longer. all right i guess so then clarie. yes ill give it to you today. right now. ill write you a check right now. oh you are a treasure aurie. you are a double treasure. you cant guess how double a treasure you are the wonderful tricounty fair was near its end and its great bicycle race with it. it was the last day of the race. hubert saint nicholas on number seven the supreme the french bicyclette with the mechanical advantage was leading the field by only one minute in total elapsed time going into that last days racing. there were those who said that hubert could win any time he wanted to and that he stayed so close only to keep the bets agrowing. and the bets did grow. the mysterious gambler with the fine figure and the extraordinary appearance rakesly rivertown was still betting the field to win against number seven. and a still more mysterious gambler working through agents was betting on number seven to place but not to win. these latter bets were quickly covered. number seven would win unless some terrible calamity overtook that entry and in the case of such terrible calamity number seven would not finish second would not finish at all most likely. the seven intrepid racers were off on their final mad twentymile circuit. interest was high especially with moneyed gamblers who followed the riders from the grandstand with their binoculars. at no place was the winding circuit course more than four miles from the grandstand and there were only three or four places not more than three hundred yards in all where the racers were out of sight of the higher tiers of the grandstand. one of those places was where little egg creek went through little egg meadow. something mysterious happened near little egg creek crossing that neither the libretto nor the enacted drama itself makes clear. hubert saint nicholas riding the french bicyclette number seven the supreme with the rearwheel drive and the mechanical advantage was unsaddled from his mount and knocked unconscious. the race master later and officially entered this incident as a careless rider knocked off his bicycle by a tree branch though hubert swore that there wasnt a tree branch within a hundred yards of that place. i was slugged by a lurker in the weeds hubert said. it was a criminal and fraudulent assault and i know who did it. then he cried oh the perfidy of women this latter seemed to be an unconnected outcry perhaps hubert had suffered a concussion. fortunately for whom the alternate rider for number seven the mysterious though duly certified masked rider was in the vicinity of the accident and took control of the bicyclette the supreme and continued the race. but number seven though having a oneminute lead ere the race began did not win. number seven did come in second though in total elapsed time. the great bicycle race is a quaint little drama with not much plot but with a pleasant and bucolic atmosphere that grows more pleasant every time the drama is played back. it is a thoroughly enjoyable journey into summertime. and there were a few more seconds of those intrusive ghost voices breaking into the closing moments of the pastoral drama. clarie i have been took bad for a big wad and i dont know how it happened. there is something funny about it all. there was something funny and familiar about that masked alternate rider for number seven. i swear that i know him from somewhere and there has always been something double funny and familiar about that gambler rakesly rivertown. i swear and be damned if i dont know him from somewhere dont worry about it aurie. you are so smart that you will have all that money made back in no time at all. yes thats true i will. but how can i write and produce and direct a drama and then get taken in it and not know what happened dont worry about it aurie. i myself doubt very much whether aurelian bentley knew about the slow sounds from nowheretown that sometimes broke into the playing of his dramas much less the slow smells which now began to give the dramas a character all their own. 4. the voyages of captain cook was the fourth of the bentleyproduced television dramas of the year 1873. in this clarinda calliope played the role of maria masina the queen of polynesia. if the great bicycle race was a journey into summertime the voyages of captain cook was a journey into tropical paradise. hubert saint nicholas played captain cook. inspiro spectralski is he a man is he a fish played the shark god. leslie whitemansion played the missionary. x. paul mccoffin played the volcano god. torres malgre played the god of the walking dead. jaime del diablo played kokomoko the bronzed surf boy and lover boy who was always holding a huge red hibiscus bloom between his white teeth. the people of the south sea islands of the captain cook drama were always eating possum and sweet potatoes and fried chicken a misconception and twanging on little banjos another misconception and talking southern u.s. darky dialect but these ghost voices were not intended to be heard on the television presentation. the complete libretto for the voyages of captain cook has survived which makes us grateful for those that have not survived for several of the dramas. the story is replete. it is better to disregard the libretto with its simultaneous curses invoked by the shark god the volcano god and the god of the walking dead and to give oneself over to the charm of the scenery which is remarkable considering that it was all filmed or seleniummatrixed in the salt swamps of new jersey. the anomalous intrusive voices are in this drama again as they will be in all the subsequent dramas. a south sea bubble yes thats what i want aurie one that cant burst. use your imagination you have so very much of it and your finances you have so very much of those and come up with something that will delight me. i swear to you clarie as soon as my finances are in a little better order i will buy any island or group of islands in the pacific ocean for you. do you hear me clarie i will give you any island or group you wish hawaii samoa fiji. name it and it is yours. so many things you promise but you dont promise them on paper only on air. maybe i will find a way to make the air retain the promises you make. not on paper not on air clarie but in real life. i will make you the real and living queen of polynesia. the essence of the south sea appeal is just plain charm. it may be that this bentley drama the voyages of captain cook was the original charm bush whence many things bloomed. no in things of this sort it is not necessary that a scion ever be in contact with its source or even know its source. without the voyages would there ever have been a sadie thompson would there have been a nellie forbush would there have been a nina daughter of almayer well they wouldnt have been as they were if clarinda calliope hadnt in a way played them first. would there have been a white shadows of the south seas if there hadnt first been the voyages of captain cook no of course there wouldnt have been. 5. crimean days was the fifth of the aurelian bentley television dramas. in this the multitalented clarinda calliope played the role of florence nightingale of ekmek kaya a turkish lady of doubtful virtue who was the numberfour wife and current favorite of the turkish admiral of chiara maldonado a young lady camp follower with the army of savoy of katya petrova who was a russian princess as well as a triple spy and of claudette boudin a french lady journalist. clarinda also masqueraded as claudettes twin brother claude a colonel with the french forces and as such she led the french to a surprising victory over the russians at eupatoria. the unmasqueraded claude himself was played by apollo montdemarsan a young actor making his first appearance in the bentley dramas. the crimean war was the last war in which the field officers of all sides leslie whitemansion was a british field officer kirbac fouet was a french jaime del diablo was an officer of the forces of savoy torres malgre was the turkish admiral inspiro spectralski was a general of the czar x. paul mccoffin was a special observer of the pope after their days of tactical maneuver and sometimes bloody conflict would dress for dinner and have formal dinner together. and it was at these dinners that clarinda calliope in her various guises shone. there was a wonderful and manyleveled table intrigue and i believe that more and more of it will come through every time the drama is replayed. and it was here in this drama that one of the most strange of the bentleyeffect phenomena first appeared. there is unmistakable evidence that some of the subvocalizations thoughts of the people were now to be heard as slow sound which was really selenium triggered slow thought. some of these manifestations were the role thoughts of the actors so strangely vocalized clarinda calliope for instance could not speak or think in any tongues except english and her own pennsylvania dutch in normal circumstances but in her triple spy roles we find her thinking out loud in turkish and greek and russian and other of the vocalizations are the real thoughts of the actors the amazingly frank intentions of leslie whitemansion and of the new apollo montdemarsan as to their lady loves of the evening after they should have received their twodollar actors fee for the day. it was a wonderful play and too intricate to be described. this one above all has to be seen. but again there was the anomalous intrusion of voices that were not a part of the scenes of the play get rid of that greek wop kid clarie. i told him he was fired and he said that he would stick around and work for nothing. he said he loved the fringe benefits. what are fringe benefits i told him id run him off and he said that this was the free state of new jersey and that no one would run him off. i wont have him around. oh aurie there isnt any greek wop kid. that was me playing that role too. am i not talented to play so many roles and you will not fire me from this role. i will continue to play it and i will be paid for it. it isnt the principle of the thing either its the two dollars. yes i understand that much about you. but you say that was you playing the part of that smartmouth apollo dago greek that couldnt be. ive seen you both at the same time. ive seen you two together too many times. ive seen you smooching each other. ah aurie that was quite an advanced technique and illusion not to mention double exposure that i used there. what other actress could play both roles at once and get away with it your techniques and illusions are becoming a little bit too advanced clarie. and do not be so sure that you are getting away with it. all through crimean days there was some tampering with history going on for dramatic effect. the light brigade for instance was successful in its famous charge and it won a great victory. but the final outcome of the war was left in doubt. aurelian bentley had somehow become a strong partisan of the russians and he refused to show them being finally defeated by the allies. 6. ruddy limbs and flaming hair is the sixth of the bentley television dramas. in this piece the dramatic clarinda calliope plays the part of muothu the maid of mars for the ruddy limbs and flaming hair are on the planet itself. there are some fantastic elements in this piece as well as amazing scientific accuracy. there is in fact a technical precocity that is really stunning. aurelian bentley has foreseen circumstances that even the scientific community did not then see and he has dealt with those circumstances. he posits for instance an atmosphere composed mostly of an eno magnetized digammated attenuated form of oxygen. being enomagnetized that atmosphere would naturally cling to its planet even though the gravity would not be strong enough to retain it otherwise. being digammated it would produce no line in the martian spectrum would have no corona or optical distortion effect and could in no way be detected from earth. and yet a human earthly would be able to breathe it freely. this was a goodnatured utopian drama of total realization and happiness. the ruddy limbs and flaming hair apply both allegorically to the planet mars and literally to the highly dramatic clarinda calliope as muothu. muothu displayed rather more of the ruddy limbs than were ordinarily shown on earth but it was explained that customs on mars were different. ruddy limbs and flaming hair was the last of the dramas in which the apparently tormented and disturbed aurelian bentley still showed the strong hand of the master as scenarist dramaturgist director and producer generally. after this we come to the four trough of the wave dramas and then the three bewildering and hectic displays on the end of the series. 7. the trenton train robbery is the seventh of the bentley television dramas and the first of the four trough plays where aurelian bentley and his effects are sunken in the slough of despond and have lost their brightness and liveliness and hope. we will pass through them quickly. in the train robbery the peerless clarinda calliope plays roxana roundhouse the daughter of the slain locomotive engineer timothy trainman roundhouse. armed with a repeating rifle a repeating shotgun a repeating pistol and a few pocketsized bombs roxana rides the rods of the crack trenton express in the effort to catch or kill the murderers of her father. these murderers have sworn that they will rob that very trenton express again. and roxana roundhouse does catch or kill all the murderers of her father. in spite of some good shots of landscapes rushing by this is not one of aurelian bentleys best efforts. and again the voices of unknown persons creep into the drama youve already flayed me clarie and scraped both sides of my pelt for whatever might cling to it. what more do you want from me go away with your lover and leave me alone. and then in a fuzzier voice apparently the thought voice made vocal the same person said or thought oh if only she would go away from me then i might have a chance for i will never be able to go away from her. grow more skin aurie the other voice said. im not nearly finished fleecing you and flaying you. oh dont look so torn up aurie. you know i could never love anyone except you. but a little token of our love is required now and then and especially now today. yes i know you are going to use your old line i gave you a million dollars last week but aurie that was last week. yes i know that you have expenses that the world wots not of. so do i. believe me aurie i wouldnt ask for these tokens of affection if i didnt want them. and then in a fuzzier voice a thought voice the same person said or thought ill never get another fish like this one and i sure cant afford to lose him. but gentle handling doesnt get it all the time. when the hook in him shows signs of working loose a bit it has to be set in again with a very hard jerk on the line. a 8. six guns on the border is the eighth of the bentley television dramas. in this drama clarinda calliope is there no end to her versatility plays the part of conchita allegre the halfbreed apache and mexican girl on the arizona border during the mexican war. conchita hates the american soldiers who are invading that area. she has them come to her secretly with promises of love and then she has them ambushed and killed. she kills many of them herself with her own six gun and she makes antimacassars out of their skins. the sort of gentlemen that conchita really likes use a lot of oil on their hair so conchita needs a lot of antimacassars at her house. but there are a few of the american officers so awkward and oafish that conchita simply cant stand to have much to do with them not even long enough to seduce them and have them killed. these horrible specimens are captain james polk played by leslie whitemansion. general zachary taylor played by kirbac fouet. captain millard fillmore played by x. paul mccoffin. captain franklin pierce played by jaime del diablo. captain james buchanan played by torres malgre. captain abraham lincoln played by inspiro spectralski. captain andrew johnson played by apollo montdemarsan. captain sam grant played by hubert saint nicholas. there was a lot of historical irony in this play but maybe it belonged somewhere else. there was a lot of comedy of manners stuff in it but it falls a little flat mostly because the eight oafish officers spared by conchita were too unmannerly to be in a comedy of manners. aurelian bentley came near the bottom of his form in this piece. but for the energy of clarinda calliope she played five other parts besides that of conchita there would have been hardly any drama at all. and as always there were those intrusive voices hovering over the playbacks. clarie believe me believe me believe me i will do all these things for you. i promise it. yes you promise it to the earless walls and to the earless me. promise it to the pen and ink and paper here. get rid of that apollo kid first clarie. you get rid of him. you have a lot of roughlooking men around. a 9. clarence greenback confidence man was the ninth of the aurelian bentley television dramas. hubert saint nicholas played the role of clarence greenback the casino owner. it was the first time that clarinda calliope had not played the lead role in a drama. is it possible that clarinda had somehow slipped or was this another instance of the left lobe of aurelian bentley having lost its cunning and casting badly. the talented prestidigitator of drama did not have his sure touch nowadays. oh sure clarinda played other roles in the drama but she did not have the lead role. clarinda played the role of gretchen the sweepout girl at the casino. she played the role of maria the mountingblock girl in the street outside the casino. she played the role of elsie the chimneysweep girl. she played the part of hennchen the scullery maid in the third and vilest kitchen of the casino. she played the part of josephine the retriever who had to gather up the shattered bodies of the suicides below suicide leap window of the casino and take them to east potters field and dig their graves and bury them. elsie made a good thing out of her job from the gold teeth of the late patrons of the casino but the dramatist and producer did not know about the good thing she had there. there were hazards in all these different roles. no of course we cant put out the fires for you to clean the chimneys said leslie whitemansion who was in charge of fireplaces and chimneys at the casino. clean them hot. and it was very hot working inside those tall chimneys with the fires roaring below and elsie the chimneysweep girl suffered. for keeping a copper coin that she found while sweeping out the casino the sadist baron von steichen played by x. paul mccoffin had gretchen hung up by her thumbs and flogged. and maria the mountingblock girl who had to stand in the muddy street outside the casino and bend her back for the gentlemen to step on her when they mounted or dismounted their horses she had it worse on the muddy days. oh the great muddy boots of those men maybe theyre trying to tell me something clarinda calliope spoke or thought by slow talkthought. i do like subtle people. but a good actress can play any role and clarinda has her revenge today. hardly anyone remembers the plot for clarence greenback confidence man but everyone remembers the tribulations of those pretty little servant girls. and then there were those other intrusive voices of the overlay. it was almost as if they belonged in another sort of drama. clarie this has to stop. not counting the special gifts and theyre fantastic im giving you ten times as much as the president of the united states is making. im ten times as good at acting as he is. and how about my special gifts and theyre fantastic. why do you have all the private detectives running around the last couple of days to spy on me to spy on everything and everyone. to save my life. frankly clarie i am afraid of being murdered. i have premonitions of being killed with a knife always with a knife. like in thirsty daggers a murder mystery that one wasnt really very well worked out and i believe its one of the things bothering you. your undermind is looking for a better solution i believe for a neater murder. it is seeking to enact a more artistic murder. i believe it will do it. i believe you will come up with quite an artistic murder for yourself. there are good murders and bad murders you see. clarie i dont intend to let myself be killed at all not by either a good or a bad murder. not even for arts sake it seems it would be worth it for the perfect murder aurie. not when im the murdered one clarie. then a moment later the female person said or thought something further in a slow thoughtvoice. sometimes persons have perfection thrust upon them in spite of themselves. an artful murder for aurie would make up for a lot of the mad art that hes been guilty of lately. 10. the vampires of varuma was the tenth of the aurelian bentley television dramas. this is the fourth and last of the trough of the wave dramas which show bentleys dramatic powers in almost complete decline and himself mightily disoriented. yet in this bottomingout there is a curious resurrection of his powers in a slightly different form. his sense of plotting and story movement did not return yet but his sense of dramatic horror as motive force was resurrected to its highest pitch. clarinda calliope played magda the peasant maid miss cheryl somerset the governess from england and the princess irene of transylvania. all three of these had been traveling to castle khubav on rational errands by the regular coach of the road and each of the three had seen all the other passengers dismount hastily and had then experienced the coach horses being whipped ahead frantically by an invisible coachman or by no coachman at all. and each of these ladies had arrived on successive days in the apparently driverless coach not at castle khubav but at the dread castle beden. and inside the castle beden were the seven no not seven eight was written into the libretto in a weirdly different hand insane counts in their castle of evil. these were count vladmel played by leslie whitemansion. count igork played by kirbac fouet. count lascar played by x. paul mccoffin. count chort played by jaime del diablo. count sangressuga played by torres malgre. count letuchaya played by inspiro spectralski is he a man is he a bat. count ulv played by hubert saint nicholas. and then there is another one added in the libretto in that weirdly different hand count prividenne played by apollo montdemarsan. there is a slipup here somewhere. apollo is supposed to have been gotten rid of to have shuffled off the mortal coil and the sheriffs report said that he died of indigestion. but if apollo has not been gotten rid of then certainly money was paid in vain. the seven or eight evil counts are sometimes conventional counts in evening clothes and monocles. and sometimes they are huge batwinged creatures flitting ponderously down the lightninglit corridors of castle beden. the castle in fact is the main character in the drama. it does not have formal lighting as it is lit by lightning all twentyfour hours of every night there is no daylight at castle beden. the floors and walls howl and chains rattle constantly. the counts have sometimes conventional sixinchlong eyeteeth and then suddenly they will have hollow fangs eighteen inches long and deadly. and there is a constant lot of howling and screaming for what is supposed to be a silent television drama. a flying count will suddenly fold his bat wings and land on the broad bosom of one of the three maidens and have into her throat with his terrible bloodsucking fangs. and every time it happens there is a horrible flopping and screeching. the voice of clarinda calliope is heard loud and clear and real in a slow angry sound. dammit aurelian thats real blood theyre taking out of my throat. and came the suave voice of the master dramatist aurelian bentley but the voices shouldnt be breaking in like this right clarie. it is on such verisimilitude that i have built my reputation as a master. clarinda in her three roles seemed to lose quite a bit of blood as the drama went on and she fell down more and more often. and the drama was a howling and bloody success no matter that the storyline was shattered in a thousand piecesfor each piece of it was like a writhing blood snake that gluts and gloats. and then after the drama itself was ended in a spate of final blood there came those intrusive voices that seemed to be out of some private drama. aurie if you are worrying about being killed how about providing for me before it happens i leave you half of my kingdom ah estate clarie right off the top of it. my word is good for this. and stop falling down. im weak. it took a lot out of me. yes your written word is good on this aurie if it is written and attested to in all the right places. lets take care of that little detail right now. clarie my spoken promise is enough and it is all that i will give. i hereby attest that half of my estate off the top belongs to you. let the eared walls of this room be witnesses to what i say clarie. if the walls of this room will swear to it then surely they will be believed. now dont bother me for a few days. i will be busy with something else. and stop falling down. its annoying. the female person then said or thought something in a fuzzy thought voice yes i believe i can make the walls of this room attest for me when the time comes. i might have to put in another amplifying circuit to be sure. and i believe that the attesting walls will be believed. the male person then said or thought something in a fuzzy thoughtvoice i have miss adeline addams now. why should i care about this calliope clown its irritating the way she keeps turning chalkwhite and falling down. i never saw anyone make such a fuss over nine quarts of blood. but now i am on a new and more glorious dawn road. is it not peculiar how a man will fall in love with one woman and out of love with another one at the same time 11. the ghost at the opera is the eleventh of the aurelian bentley television dramas in the year 1873. the ghost is based on verdis il trovatore but bentleys production is quite original for all that. the role of leonora is played by miss adeline addams. but the same role is also played by clarinda calliope who was originally selected to play the role by herself. this business of having two different persons playing the same role creates a certain duality one might almost say a certain duplicity in the drama. the ghost is the doubling it is the inept and stumbling clarinda trying again and again to sing parts of the leonora role and failing in it totally and being jerked off stage by the stage managers crook and it is the beautiful and brimming genius adeline addams coming on and performing the same role brilliantly. this provides the cruel comedy that is usually lacking in verdi for without cruelty only a limited success is ever possible in opera. but clarinda took some very bad falls from the stagemans crook jerking her off her feet and besides she was still weak and falling down from all the blood she had lost in her roles in the vampires of varuma. she was suffering. why do you go through with it clarinda hubert saint nicholas asked her once in an outsideoftheplayitself voice. why do you allow yourself to be tortured and humiliated like that only for the money clarinda was heard to say. only for the actors fee of four dollars a day. i am clear broke and i am hungry. but if i can stick it out to the end of the opera i will have four dollars tonight for my wages. four dollars clarinda the rest of us get only two dollars a day. are you playing another role that i dont know about yes i am also playing the role of wilhelmina the outhouse cleaner. but i thought that you had millions from that old tyrant clarinda. its gone hubie all gone. i had expenses that the world wotted not of. i gave apollo most of the money when i was in love with him. and i gave the rest of it to him to do a special favor for me. you gave the money to him today but he was buried yesterday. time seems to go faster as we get older doesnt it meanwhile back on the opera stage a new verdi was being hammered out. leslie whitemansion was playing manrico. x. paul mccoffin was playing ferrando. hubert saint nicholas was playing count di luni. apollo montdemarsan was playing the ghost. but was there a ghost in the libretto besides the double ghost of the two females playing the same role yes there was there was a real ghost in the libretto. it was written in there in a queer other hand really a ghostly hand and it wrote that apollo was playing the role of the ghost. so the merry comic opera went along almost to its end. it was just when manrico was being led to the executioners block and the evil count di luni was gloating in triumph when everything was finally being shaped up in that drama that had some pleasure for everybody that a horrible thing happened in one of the loges or boxes that overhung the stage. aurelian bentley was knifed there in his box at the opera. oh god this was murder your mind is looking for a better solution i believe for a neater murder. oh that had been the voice of another sort of ghost. but now to be slain by the ghost of a man dead only a day or two and in the presence of several thousands of persons here for it was possibly none other than apollo montdemarsan who had been gotten rid of who was getting rid of aurelian bentley. and again there are good murders and bad murders you see … it seems it would be worth it for arts sake for the perfect murder. aurelian bentley was stabbed to death in his box at the opera there but even he had to admit with some appreciation as he went that it was done with art. and immediately as the opera on stage came to its great conclusion there welled up cries of author author bentley bentley then the dying or more likely dead man rose for the last time bowed formally and tumbled out of his box and onto his face on the stage stark dead and with the thirsty now slaked dagger twinkling between the blades of his shoulders. what other man had ever made such an exit from or on lifes stage that was theater that was drama 12. an evening in newport was intended to be the twelfth of the bentley television dramas. but it was never produced possibly because of the death of its producer. it exists only as a libretto. there was a high society drama of manners as miss adeline addams knew it as aurelian bentley with his quick mind and quick mimicry knew it from his brief brushes with it. but does not a drama or comedy of manners depend largely on the quip and the arch aphorism how could it be done in silent presentation by art thats how it might be done by the perfect art of the silent mimes and aurelian bentley was master of that art. by the gestures by the facial implications by great silent acting this might be done. was there any witticism that adeline addams could not express with her talented high society face was there any devastating riposte that she could not give with her autocratic hands it was never tested but aurelian believed that she was pretty good. on the lower level an evening in newport was a onesided duel between mistress adeline addams of newport playing the role of mistress adela adams of newport and clarinda calliope playing the role of rosaleen okeene a low vicious ignorant filthy badmannered fifth parlor maid newly arrived from ireland. it was a stacked set in favor of adelineadela. on the higher level the drama was the passionate portrayal of the total love of a beautiful and wealthy and intelligent and charming and aristocratic young lady adelineadela for a man of surpassing genius and ineffable charm a man of poise and power and heroic gifts a man the like of whom will hardly appear once in a century. the drama was supposed to take on a note of hushed wonder whenever this man was mentioned or so the libretto said. the libretto does not identify this exceptional man but our own opinion is that the librettist aurelian bentley intended this hardlyonceinacentury man the object of the torrid and devoted love of miss adeline addams to be himself aurelian bentley. but an evening in newport intended to be the surpassing climax of that first and still unsurpassed television series was never produced. 13. pettifoggers of philadelphia is the noncanonical apocryphal thirteenth apocalypse of the wonderful world of aurelian bentley that first and greatest television series. there is no libretto to it. there is no formal production and it does not carry the bentley seal of production. but it does repose in one of the old television receivers the one that was aurelians own control receiver the one that was in aurelians own luxurious den where he spent so many hectic hours with clarinda calliope and later with adeline addams. it reposes there and it may be seen and heard there. though bentley was already dead when these scenes were ordered and livepresented yet he walks in them and talks in them. the experience of hearing the thoughts and words of a hovering dead man spoken out loud and of seeing him as if in the flesh is a shattering but dramatic one. the setting and sole scene of pettifoggers of philadelphia is that same luxurious den of aurelian bentleys first placed under court seal but then opened for a meeting which as one of the parties to it stated could not validly be held anywhere else. a probate judge was present and pettifoggers representing several of the parties and two of the parties themselves. it was a hearing on the disposition of the estate of aurelian bentley of what might be left of that estate he having died without having made a will. but one of the parties clarinda calliope insisted that bentley had made a will that the will was in this particular room and no other that the will in fact was this room and the eared and tongued walls of it. there seemed to be several meetings in this room superimposed on one another and they cannot be sorted out. to sort them out would have been to destroy their effect however for they achieved syntheses of their several aspects and became the true meeting that never really took place but which contained all the other meetings in one theatrical unity. the pettifogger of a second cousin once removed was there to present the claim of that distant person as next in kin to the estate of aurelian bentley. the pettifogger of adeline addams of newport was there to present the claim of adeline to the estate claims based on an irrefutable promise. this irrefutable promise was the marriage license for aurelian bentley and adeline addams. it was not signed or witnessed of course. the marriage the pettifogger said had been scheduled to take place on a certain night after the presentation of an opera that was contained in a television drama that was contained in a riddle. but aurelian bentley had been killed during that opera which voided the prospect of marriage but he did not void the promise. there were pettifoggers there for the different creditors. and all the pettifoggers were from philadelphia. and there was clarinda calliope representing herself as portia she insisted and not as a pettifogger and she claimed rights by a promise too big and too intricate to be put on paper. there was the probate judge of the private hearing who ambled around the luxurious den flipping a silver dollar in the air and humming the mcgintys saloon waltz. oh stop flipping that silly silver dollar and get on with the matter of the probate miss adeline addams complained to that nitwit judge. the silver dollar is the matter of the probate the judge said. the dollar is important. it is the soul and body of what this is all about. the piles of paper began to accumulate on the tables there. there were the documents and attestations of the distant next of kin of adeline addams and of the creditors in their severality. and not one scrap of paper did clarinda calliope put forward. enough enough said the judge after the flood of paper had narrowed down to a trickle. stop the paper but he didnt stop flipping that silver dollar or humming that mcgintys saloon waltz. all asea thats going a sea miss calliope it is time you laid a little evidence on the table if you are to be a party to these hearings. my evidence is too large and too living to lay on the table clarinda said. but listen and perhaps look. due to the magic of the selenium slow response principle and to the walls of this very room being wired parallel to the receiver in this room we may be able to bring to you a veritable reconstruction of past words and avowals and persons. and pretty soon the voice of the onceinacentury man began ghostly at first and then gradually taking on flesh. oh aurelian adeline addams squealed. where are you he is here present in this room where he spent so many wonderful hours with me clarinda said. all right aurie baby talk a little bit clearer and start materializing. all these things i will give you clarie came the voice of aurelian bentley and bentley was there in shadow form of himself. no one else would give you so much. no one else would ever care so much … trust me clarie. aurelian bentley was standing there solidly now. it was a three dimensional projection or recreation of him coming into focus from all the eared and eyed and remembering walls of the room that was wired in parallel to the television receiver. aurelian stood in the midst of them there in his own luxurious den. clarie i will do handsomely by you … a million dollars my love and i will give it to you. oh these were startling and convincing words coming from the living ghost there i swear to you clarie … i will buy any island or group of islands in the pacific ocean for you … hawaii samoa fiji. name it and its yours. what man ever made such tall promises and with such obvious sincerity not on paper not on air clarie but in real life. i will make you the real and living queen. if they will not listen to one risen from the dead whom will they listen to clarie believe me believe me believe me i will do all things for you. i promise it. how are you going to top something like that i leave you … my kingdom ah estate clarie. my word is good for that. it was all in the bag and the drawstring was being tightened on the bag. i hereby attest that ... my estate ... belongs to you. let the eared walls of this room be witnesses to what i say clarie. if the walls of this room will swear to it then surely they will be believed. the image of aurelian bentley disappeared and his sound was extinguished with a sharp snipping sound. adeline addams was putting a scissors back into her handbag. ive meant to find out what that wire there was for several times she said. that sort of shuts it all off when the wire is cut doesnt it here here you are guilty of destroying my evidence clarinda calliope said. you can go to prison for that you can burn in fire for that a sudden flaming hay wagon with a wild woman driving it rushed into the room and seemed about to destroy everyone in the room. everyone cringed from it except clarinda and the probate judge. the flaming hay wagon did crash into all the people of the room but it did them no damage. it was only a scene from one of the earlier plays. you didnt think that clarinda had only one circuit in that room did you but several of the persons were shaken by the threat. good show said the probate judge. i guess it wins what there is left to win. no no adeline cried. you cant give her the estate whats left of it sure said the judge still flipping the silver dollar. it isnt the principle either said clarinda its the dollar. she plucked the silver dollar out of the air as the probate judge was still flipping it. this is the entire residue of the estate isnt it she asked to be sure. right calliope right the judge said. thats all that was left of it. he continued to flip an invisible coin into the air and he whistled the last sad bars of the mcgintys saloon waltz. anybody know where a good actress can get a job clarinda asked. going rates two dollars a day per role. she swept out of the room with head and spirits high. she was a consummate actress. the other persons fade out into indistinct sounds and indistinct shadows on the old kerosenepowered television receiver.   the prospects of retrieval and revival of the first and greatest of all television series the wonderful world of aurelian bentley recorded and produced in the year 1873 is in grave danger. the only true and complete version of the series reposes in one single television receiver aurelian bentleys own control receiver the one that he kept in his own luxurious den where he spent so many happy hours with his ladies. the original librettos are stored in this set they are in fact a part of this set and they may not for inexplicable reasons be removed to any great distance from it. all the deep and evergrowing side talk slow talk is in this set all the other sets are mute. all the final drama pettifoggers of philadelphia is recorded on this set and is in none of the others. there is a whole golden era of television recorded in this set. i bought this old keroseneburning treasure from its last owner he did not know what it was i told him that it was a chestnut roaster for eighteen dollars. now by a vexing coincidence this last owner has inherited forty acres of land with a fine stand of chestnut trees and he wants the chestnut roaster back. and he has the law on his side. i bought it from him and i paid him for it of course. but the check i gave him for it was hotter than a selenium rectifier on a shorted circuit. i have to make up the eighteen dollars or lose the receiver and its stored wealth. i have raised thirteen dollars and fifty cents from three friends and one enemy. i still need four dollars and a half. oh wait wait here is ninetyeight cents in pennies brought in by the children for the wonderful world of aurelian bentley preservation fund. i still need three dollars and fiftytwo cents. anyone wishing to contribute to this fund had best do so quickly before this golden era of television is lost forever. due to the fussiness of the government contributions are not taxdeductible. it is worth preserving as a remnant of that early era when there were giants on the earth. and if it is preserved someday someone will gaze into the old kerosenepowered receiver and cry out in astonishment in the words of the greatest bard a  what poetrace shot such cyclopean arches at the stars r. a. lafferty was a gadfly. paradoxically he was never a writer i likedand even today i think of him as someone i am always being asked to write about. because hes so smart its always a compliment. the first time decades ago terry carr asked me to blurb his novel past master i felt that same way. his works are wryly humorousthough i always realize moments after the laughter i am the butt of the joke. i never met himhe was from oklahoma and lived his life in tulsa with his sister while tales of his alcoholic excess at sf conventions filtered up through the sf community. the primary education of the camiroi is among other things a story about linguistic drift as human society spreads more and more widely over more and more diverse landscapes. among the surprises the story offers is a fictive revelation that the flowering of ancient greek civilization was an incursion an invasion of the camiroi centuries ago. camiroi children have to learn to read more and more slowly rather than faster and faster. laffertys tale was written in the 1950s when a nation wide craze for speedreading courses swept the anglophone world among the most popular one from evelyn wood. i was a slow readeri was someone who wondered if i would not profit by taking an evelyn wood course… every once in a while in their topsyturvy world a familiar idea introduction by samuel r. delany the primary education of the camiroi swims by can you imagine a person so sick that he would desire to hold high office for any great period of time one of the reasons i wanted to be a writer in the first place is so that i could observe the effects of politics without being directly responsible for them. this is in a section of text on education that ends with our learning that the camiroi children design and construct their own school buildings. lafferty had his enthusiasmthe choctaw indians of his local area whom he championed in the mythic novel okla hannali 1972 published by university of oklahoma presssadly not a book i have read though it comes with high praise from writers on the topic such as dee brown. diogenes the cynic is the philosopher who suggested during the time of plato that perhaps education would go better if the teachers were beaten when their students did poorly … this is the tradition laffertys tales emerge from. and one has a far better understanding of this after one has been a teacher and perhaps retired from the position than before. the last half dozen pages of the camirois primary education are a list of courses decided up by year which end with a comment on what this progression might accomplish if it were constituted on earth. the comment contains three recommendations as to how to accomplish these ends. since they include kidnapping book burning and the murdering judicious hanging of certain malingering students the tale is both witty and troubling in the tradition of swifts modest proposal. and that is where a good bit of laffertys satire originates. one of my favorite lafferty anecdotes i only discovered it on wikipedia minutes ago comes from david langford in the magazine sfx 2002 once a french publisher nervously asked whether lafferty minded being compared to g. k. chesterton a catholic author whose distributism got him compared favorably to marx and there was a terrifying silence that went on and on. was the great man hideously offended eventually very slowly he said youre on the right track kid and wandered away. even while i still find the stories unsettling lafferty seems on the right track … abstract from joint report to the general dubuque pta concerning the primary education of the camiroi subtitled critical observations of a parallel culture on a neighboring world and evaluations of the other way of education. extract from the day book where we asked the information factor at camiroi city terminal is the office of the local pta isnt any he said cheerfully. you mean that in camiroi city the metropolis of the planet there is no pta our chairman paul piper asked with disbelief. isnt any office of it. but youre poor strangers so you deserve an answer even if you cant frame your questions properly. see that elderly man sitting on the bench and enjoying the sun go tell him you need a pta. hell make you one. perhaps the initials convey a different meaning on camiroi said miss munch the first surrogate chairman. by them we mean parent teachers apparatus of course. colloquial english is one of the six earthian languages required here you know. dont be abashed. hes a fine person and he enjoys doing things for strangers. hell be glad to make you a pta. the primary education of the camiroi we were nonplussed but we walked over to the man indicated. we are looking for the local pta sir said miss smice our second surrogate chairman. we were told that you might help us. oh certainly said the elderly camiroi gentleman. one of you arrest that man walking there and well get started with it. do what asked our mr. piper. arrest him. i have noticed that your own words sometimes do not convey a meaning to you. i often wonder how you do communicate among yourselves. arrest take into custody seize by any force physical or moral and bring him here. yes sir cried miss hanks our third surrogate chairman. she enjoyed things like this. she arrested the walking camiroi man with force partly physical and partly moral and brought him to the group. its a pta they want meander the elder camiroi said to the one arrested. grab three more and well get started. let the lady help. shes good at it. our miss hanks and the camiroi man named meander arrested three other camiroi men and brought them to the group. five. its enough said the elderly camiroi. we are hereby constituted a pta and ordered into random action. now how can we accommodate you good earth people but are you legal are you five persons competent to be a pta demanded our mr. piper. any camiroi citizen is competent to do any job on the planet of camiroi said one of the camiroi men we learned later that his name was talarium otherwise camiroi would be in a sad shape. it may be said our miss smice sourly. it all seems very informal. what if one of you had to be world president the odds are that it wont come to one man in ten said the elderly camiroi his name was philoxenus. im the only one of this group ever to serve as president of this planet and it was a pleasant week i spent in the office. now to the point. how can we accommodate you we would like to see one of your schools in session said our mr. piper. we would like to talk to the teachers and the students. we are here to compare the two systems of education. there is no comparison said old philoxenus meaning no offense. or no more than a little. on camiroi we practice education. on earth they play a game but they call it by the same name. that makes the confusion. come. well go to a school in session. and to a public school said miss smice suspiciously. do not fob off any fancy private school on us as typical. that would be difficult said philoxenus. there is no public school in camiroi city and only two remaining on the planet. only a small fraction of one percent of the students of camiroi are in public schools. we maintain that there is no more reason for the majority of children to be educated in a public school than to be raised in a public orphanage. we realize of course that on earth you have made a sacred buffalo of the public school. sacred cow said our mr. piper. children and earthlings should be corrected when they use words wrongly said philoxenus. how else will they learn the correct forms the animal held sacred in your own near orient was of the species bos bubalus rather than bos bos a buffalo rather than a cow. shall we go to a school if it cannot be a public school at least let it be a typical school said miss smice. that again is impossible said philoxenus. every school on camiroi is in some respect atypical. we went to visit an atypical school. incident our first contact with the camiroi students was a violent one. one of them a lively little boy about eight years old ran into miss munch knocked her down and broke her glasses. then he jabbered something in an unknown tongue. is that camiroi asked mr. piper with interest. from what i have heard i supposed the language to have a harsher and fuller sound. you mean you dont recognize it asked philoxenus with amusement. what a droll admission from an educator. the boy is very young and very ignorant. seeing that you were earthians he spoke in hindi which is the tongue used by more earthians than any other. no no xypete they are of the minority who speak english. you can tell it by their colorless texture and the narrow heads on them. i say you sure do have slow reaction lady the little boy xypete explained. even subhumans should react faster than that. you just stand there and gape and let me bowl you over. you want me analyze you and see why you react so slow no no you seem unhurt in structure from the fall the little boy continued but if i hurt you i got to fix you. just strip down to your shift and ill go over you and make sure youre all right. no no no its all right said philoxenus. all camiroi children learn primary medicine in the first grade setting bones and healing contusions and such. no no im all right. but hes broken my glasses. come along earthside lady ill make you some others said the little boy. with your slow reaction time you sure cant afford the added handicap of defective vision. shall i fit you with contacts no. i want glasses just like those which were broken. oh heavens what will i do you come i do said the little boy. it was rather revealing to us that the little boy was able to test miss munchs eyes grind lenses make frames and have her fixed up within three minutes. i have made some improvements over those you wore before the boy said to help compensate for your slow reaction time. are all the camiroi students so talented mr. piper asked. he was impressed. no. xypete is unusual philoxenus said. most students would not be able to make a pair of glasses so quickly or competently till they were at least nine. random interviews how rapidly do you read miss hanks asked a young girl. one hundred and twenty words a minute the girl said. on earth some of the girl students your age have learned to read at the rate of five hundred words a minute miss hanks said proudly. when i began disciplined reading i was reading at the rate of four thousands words a minute the girl said. they had quite a time correcting me of it. i had to take remedial reading and my parents were ashamed of me. now ive learned to read almost slow enough. i dont understand said miss hanks.  do you know anything about earth history or geography miss smice asked a middlesized boy. we sure are sketchy on it lady. there isnt very much over there is there then you have never heard of dubuque count dubuque interests me. i cant say as much for the city named after him. i always thought that the count handled the matters of the conflicting french and spanish land grants and the basic claims of the sauk and fox indians very well. references to the town now carry a humorous connotation and school teacher from dubuque has become a folk archetype. thank you said miss smice or do i thank you a what are you taught of the relative humanity of the earthians and the camiroi and of their origins miss munch asked a camiroi girl. the other four worlds earth gaea kentauron mikron dahae and astrobe were all settled from camiroi. that is what we are taught. we are also given the humorous aside that if it isnt true we will still hold it true till something better comes along. it was we who rediscovered the four worlds in historic time not they who discovered us. if we did not make the original settlements at least we have filed the first claim that we made them. we did in historical time make an additional colonization of earth. you call it the incursion of the dorian greeks.  where are their playgrounds miss hanks asked talarium. oh the whole world. the children have the run of everything. to set up specific playgrounds would be like setting a tablesized aquarium down in the depths of the ocean. it would really be pointless.  a conference the four of us from earth specifically from dubuque iowa were in discussion with the five members of the camiroi pta. how do you maintain discipline mr. piper asked. indifferently said philoxenus. oh you mean in detail. it varies. sometimes we let it drift sometimes we pull them up short. once they have learned that they must comply to an extent there is little trouble. small children are often put down into a pit. they do not eat or come out till they know their assignment. but that is inhuman said miss hanks. of course. but small children are not yet entirely human. if a child has not learned to accept discipline by the third or fourth grade he is hanged. literally asked miss munch. how would you hang a child figuratively and what effect would that have on the other children by the neck miss munch still was not satisfied. by the neck until they are dead. the other children always accept the example gracefully and do better. hanging isnt employed often. scarcely one child in a hundred is hanged. what is this business about slow reading miss hanks asked. i dont understand it at all. only the other day there was a child in the third grade who persisted in rapid reading philoxenus said. he was given an object lesson. he was given a book of medium difficulty and he read it rapidly. then he had to put the book away and repeat what he had read. do you know that in the first thirty pages he missed four words midway in the book there was a whole statement which he had understood wrongly and there were hundreds of pages that he got wordperfect only with difficulty. if he was so unsure on material that he had just read think how imperfectly he would have recalled it forty years later. you mean that the camiroi children learn to recall everything that they read the camiroi children and adults will recall for life every detail they have a ever seen read or heard. we on camiroi are only a little more intelligent than you on earth. we cannot afford to waste time in forgetting or reviewing or in pursuing anything of a shallowness that lends itself to scanning. ah would you call your schools liberal mr. piper asked. i would. you wouldnt said philoxenus. we do not on camiroi as you do on earth use words to mean their opposites. there is nothing in our education or on our world that corresponds to the quaint servility which you call liberal on earth. well would you call your education progressive no. in your argot progressive of course means infantile. how are the schools financed asked mr. piper. oh the voluntary tithe on camiroi takes care of everything government religion education public works. we dont believe in taxes of course and we never maintain a high overhead in anything. just how voluntary is the tithing asked miss hanks. do you sometimes hang those who do not tithe voluntarily i believe there have been a few cases of that sort said philoxenus. and is your government really as slipshod as your education mr. piper asked. are your high officials really chosen by lot and for short periods oh yes. can you imagine a person so sick that he would actually desire to hold high office for any great period of time are there any further questions there must be hundreds said mr. piper. but we find difficulty putting them into words. if you cannot find words for them we cannot find answers. pta disbanded.   conclusion a the camiroi system of education is inferior to our own in organization in buildings in facilities in playgrounds in teacher conferences in funding in parental involvement in supervision in ingroup outgroup accommodation adjustment motifs. some of the school buildings are grotesque. we asked about one particular building which seemed to us to be flamboyant and in bad taste. what do you expect from secondgrade children they said. it is well built even if of peculiar appearance. second grade children are not yet complete artists of design. you mean that the children designed it themselves we asked. of course they said. designed and built it. it isnt a bad job for children. such a thing wouldnt be permitted on earth. conclusion b the camiroi system of education somehow produces much better results than does the education system of earth. we have been forced to admit this by the evidence at hand. conclusion c there is an anomaly as yet unresolved between conclusion a and conclusion b. appendix to joint report we give here as perhaps of some interest the curriculum of the camiroi primary education. first year course playing one wind instrument. simple drawing of objects and numbers. singing. this is important. many earth people sing who cannot sing. this early instruction of the camiroi prevents that occurrence. simple arithmetic hand and machine. first acrobatics. first riddles and logic. mnemonic religion. first dancing. walking the low wire. simple electric circuits. raising ants. eoempts not earth ants. second year course playing one keyboard instrument. drawing faces letters motions. singing comedies. complex arithmetic

hypogyroscopic economy. penentaglossia. the perfection of the fifty languages that every educated camiroi must know including six earthian languages. of course the child will already have colloquial mastery of most of these but he will not yet have them in their full depth. construction of complex societies. world government. a course of the same name is sometimes given in earthian schools but the course is not of the same content. in this course the camiroi student will govern a world though not one of the first aspect worlds for a period of three or four months. tenth form thesis. comment on curriculum the child will now be fifteen years old and will have completed his primary education. in many ways he will be advanced beyond his earth counterpart. physically more sophisticated the camiroi child could kill with his hands an earthtype tiger or a cape buffalo. an earth child would perhaps be reluctant even to attempt such feats. the camiroi boy or girl could replace any professional earth athlete at any position of any game and could surpass all existing earth records. it is simply a question of finer poise strength and speed the result of adequate schooling. as to the arts on which earthlings sometimes place emphasis the camiroi child could produce easy and unequaled masterpieces in any medium. more important he will have learned the relative unimportance of such pastimes. the camiroi child will have failed in business once at age ten and have learned patience and perfection of objective by his failure. he will have acquired the techniques of falsification and conmanship. thereafter he will not be easily deceived by any of the citizens of any of the worlds. the camiroi child will have become a complex genius and a simple saint the latter reduces the index of camiroi crime to near zero. he will be married and settled in those early years of greatest enjoyment. the child will have built from materials found around any camiroi house a fasterthanlight vehicle. he will have piloted it on a significant journey of his own plotting and programming. he will have built quasihuman robots of great intricacy. he will be of perfect memory and judgment and will be well prepared to accept solid learning. he will have learned to use his whole mind for the vast reservoirs which are the unconscious to us are not unconscious to him. everything in him is ordered for use. and there seems to be no great secret about the accomplishments only to do everything slowly enough and in the right order thus they avoid repetition and drill which are the shriveling things which dull the quick apperception. the camiroi schedule is challenging to the children but it is nowhere impossible or discouraging. everything builds to what follows. for instance the child is eleven years old before he is given postnuclear physics and universals. such subjects might be too difficult for him at an earlier age. he is thirteen years old before he undertakes category invention that intricate course with the simple name. he is fourteen years old when he enters the dangerous field of panphilosophical clarification. but he will have been constructing comprehensive philosophies for two years and he will have the background for the final clarification. we should look more closely at this other way of education. in some respects it is better than our own. few earth children would be able to construct an organic and sentient robot within fifteen minutes if given the test suddenly most of them could not manufacture a living dog in that time. not one earth child in five could build a fasterthanlight vehicle and travel it beyond our galaxy between now and midnight. not one earth child in a hundred could build a planet and have it a going concern within a week. not one in a thousand would be able to comprehend pentacosmic logic. recommendations a. kidnapping five camiroi at random and constituting them a pilot earth pta. b. a little constructive bookburning particularly in the education field. c. judicious hanging of certain malingering students. some stories you dont forget. i first read r. a. laffertys continued on next rock over forty years ago in the autumn of 1975. i remember it exactly. i was in graduate school taking a masters degree and id signed up for a course in science fiction. the text was speculations an introduction to literature through fantasy and science fiction edited by thomas e. sanders. it included poetry three essays and fortyone stories. i know the exact number because i still have the book. the stories ranged widely including genre precursors by nathaniel hawthorne herman melville and rudyard kipling 1940s stories by writers such as walter van tilburg clark murray leinster and judith merril and a lot of newer stories by thencurrent stars like robert silverberg theodore sturgeon and robert sheckley. i read the entire volume the first weekend after i purchased it. among the stories was continued on next rock. i read it puzzled a while and read it again. this was different. this was way different. it was clearly a love story but not like any id ever read. magdalen and anteros seemed very strange if not downright crazy. actually they are crazy. sexually obsessed he chases her through time leaving amorous poems in strata of ancient rock. she spurns him in what may or may not be a courtship ritual. or murder. the writing was wonderful the characters inventive the tone perfectly balanced between wryness and passion the kind of passion that annihilates. i could not get it out of my head. a few years later a different one of my graduateschool professors whod introduction by nancy kress continued on next rock become a friend told me how much he admired r. a. lafferty. he gave me a bound uncorrected pageproof copy of iron tears the 1992 lafferty collection from edgewood press i still have this volume too. i thanked him but my main reaction was indignation that the fifteen stories in the volume didnt include continued on next rock. my admiration for the story which i just read yet again has only grown. after all anteross love poems are if nothing else unique you are the freedom of wild pigs in the sourgrass and the nobility of badgers. you are the brightness of serpents and the soaring of vultures. you are passion of mesquite bushes on fire with lightning. you are serenity of toads. as i saidunique courtship poetry. and how come no man has ever told me that i am the nobility of badgers let alone the serenity of toads why not i ask you maybe if i could have done the things that magdalen could … up in the big lime country there is an upthrust a chimney rock that is half fallen against a newer hill. it is formed of what is sometimes called dawson sandstone and is interlaced with tough shale. it was formed during the glacial and recent ages in the bottom lands of crow creek and green river when these streams at least five times were mighty rivers. the chimney rock is only a little older than mankind only a little younger than grass. its formation had been upthrust and then eroded away again all but such harder parts as itself and other chimneys and blocks. a party of five persons came to this place where the chimney rock had fallen against a stillnewer hill. the people of the party did not care about the deep limestone below they were not geologists. they did care about the newer hill it was manmade and they did care a little about the rock chimney they were archeologists. here was time heaped up bulging out in casing and accumulation and not in line sequence. and here also was striated and banded time grown tall and then shattered and broken. the five party members came to the site early in the afternoon bringing the working trailer down a dry creek bed. they unloaded many things and made a camp there. it wasnt really necessary to make a camp on the ground. there was a good motel two miles away on the highway there was a road along the ridge above. they could have lived in comfort and made the trip to the site in five minutes every morning. terrence burdock however believed that one could not get the feel of a digging unless he lived on the ground with it day and night. continued on next rock  the five persons were terrence burdock his wife ethyl robert derby and howard steinleser four beautiful and balanced people. and magdalen mobley who was neither beautiful nor balanced. but she was electric she was special. they rouched around in the formations a little after they had made camp and while there was still light. all of them had seen the formations before and had guessed that there was promise in them. that peculiar fluting in the broken chimney is almost like a core sample terrence said and it differs from the rest of it. its like a lightning bolt through the whole length. its already exposed for us. i believe we will remove the chimney entirely. it covers the perfect access for the slash in the mound and it is the mound in which we are really interested. but well study the chimney first. it is so available for study. oh i can tell you everything thats in the chimney magdalen said crossly. i can tell you everything thats in the mound too. i wonder why we take the trouble to dig if you already know what we will find ethyl sounded archly. i wonder too magdalen grumbled. but we will need the evidence and the artifacts to show. you cant get appropriations without evidence and artifacts. robert go kill that deer in the brush about forty yards northeast of the chimney. we may as well have deer meat if were living primitive. this isnt deer season robert derby objected. and there isnt any deer there. or if there is its down in the draw where you couldnt see it. and if theres one there its probably a doe. no robert it is a twoyearold buck and a very big one. of course its in the draw where i cant see it. forty yards northeast of the chimney would have to be in the draw. if i could see it the rest of you could see it too. now go kill it are you a man or a mus microtus howard cut poles and set up a tripod to string and dress the deer on. you had better try the thing robert ethyl burdock said or well have no peace this evening.  robert derby took a carbine and went northeastward of the chimney descending into the draw forty yards away. there was the high ping of the carbine shot. and after some moments robert returned with a curious grin. you didnt miss him robert you killed him magdalen called loudly. you got him with a good shot through the throat and up into the brain when he tossed his head high like they do. why didnt you bring him go back and get him get him i couldnt even lift the thing. terrence and howard come with me and well lash it to a pole and get it here somehow. oh robert youre out of your beautiful mind magdalen chided. it only weighs a hundred and ninety pounds. oh ill get it. magdalen mobley went and got the big buck. she brought it back carrying it listless across her shoulders and getting herself bloodied stopping sometimes to examine rocks and kick them with her foot coming on easily with her load. it looked as if it might weigh two hundred and fifty pounds but if magdalen said it weighed a hundred and ninety that is what it weighed. howard steinleser had cut poles and made a tripod. he knew better than not to. they strung the buck up skinned it off ripped up its belly drew it and worked it over in an almost professional manner. cook it ethyl magdalen said. later as they sat on the ground around the fire and it had turned dark ethyl brought the bucks brains to magdalen messy and not halfcooked believing that she was playing an evil trick. and magdalen ate them avidly. they were her due. she had discovered the buck. if you wonder how magdalen knew what invisible things were where so did the other members of the party always wonder. it bedevils me sometimes why i am the only one to notice the analogy between historical geology and depth psychology terrence burdock mused as they grew lightly profound around the campfire. the isostatic principle applies to the mind and the undermind as well as it does to the surface and undersurface of the earth. the mind has its erosions and weatherings going on along with its deposits and accumulations. it also has its upthrusts and its stresses. it floats on a similar magma. in extreme cases it has its volcanic eruptions and its mountain building. and it has its glaciations ethyl burdock said and perhaps she was looking at her husband in the dark. the mind has its hard sandstone sometimes transmuted to quartz or halftransmuted into flint from the drifting and floating sand of daily events. it has its shale from the old mud of daily ineptitudes and inertias. it has limestone out of its more vivid experiences for lime is the remnant of what was once animate and this limestone may be true marble if it is the deposit of rich enough emotion or even travertine if it has bubbled sufficiently through agonized and evocative rivers of the undermind. the mind has its sulfur and its gemstones terrence bubbled on sufficiently and magdalen cut him off. say simply that we have rocks in our heads she said. but theyre random rocks i tell you and the same ones keep coming back. it isnt the same with us as it is with the earth. the world gets new rocks all the time. but its the same people who keep turning up and the same minds. damn one of the samest of them just turned up again i wish hed leave me alone. the answer is still no. very often magdalen said things that made no sense. ethyl burdock assured herself that neither her husband nor robert nor howard had slipped over to magdalen in the dark. ethyl was jealous of the chunky and surly girl. i am hoping that this will be as rich as spiro mound howard steinleser hoped. it could be you know. im told that there was never a less prepossessing site than that or a trickier one. i wish we had someone who had dug at spiro. oh he dug at spiro magdalen said with contempt. he who terrence burdock asked. no one of us was at spiro. magdalen you werent even born yet when that mound was opened. what could you know about it yeah i remember him at spiro magdalen said galways turning up his own things and pointing them out. were you at spiro terrence suddenly asked a piece of darkness. for some time they had all been vaguely aware that there were six not five persons around the fire. yeah i was at spiro the man said. i dig there. i dig at a lot of the digs. i dig real well and i always know when we come to something that will be important. you give me a job. who are you terrence asked him. the man was pretty visible now. the flame of the fire seemed to leap toward him as if he compelled it. oh im just a rich old poor man who keeps following and hoping and asking. there is one who is worth it all forever so i solicit that one forever. and sometimes i am other things. two hours ago i was the deer in the draw. it is an odd thing to munch ones own flesh. and the man was munching a joint of the deer unasked. him and his damn cheap poetry magdalen cried angrily. whats your name terrence asked him. manypenny. anteros manypenny is my name forever. what are you oh just indian. shawnee choc creek anadarko caddo and pre caddo. lots of things. how could anyone be precaddo like me. i am. is anteros a creek name no. greek. man i am a going jessie i am one digging man i show you tomorrow. man he was one digging man he showed them tomorrow. with a short handled rose hoe he began the gash in the bottom of the mound working too swiftly to be believed. he will smash anything that is there. he will not know what he comes to ethyl burdock complained. woman i will not smash whatever is there anteros said. you can hide a wrens egg in one cubic meter of sand. i will move all the sand in one minute. i will uncover the egg wherever it is. and i will not crack the egg. i sense these things. i come now to a small pot of the protoplano period. it is broken of course but i do not break it. it is in six pieces and they will fit together perfectly. i tell you this beforehand. now i reveal it. and anteros revealed it. there was something wrong about it even before he uncovered it. but it was surely a find and perhaps it was of the proto plano period. the six shards came out. they were roughly cleaned and set. it was apparent that they would fit wonderfully. why it is perfect ethyl exclaimed. it is too perfect howard steinleser protested. it was a turned pot and who had turned pots in america without the potters wheel but the glyphs pressed into it do correspond to protoplano glyphs. it is fishy. steinleser was in a twitchy humor today and his face was livid.   yes it is the ripple and the spinosity the fishglyph anteros pointed out. and the sunsign is riding upon it. it is fishgod. its fishy in another way steinleser insisted. nobody finds a thing like that in the first sixty seconds of a dig. and there could not be such a pot. i wouldnt believe it was protoplano unless points were found in the exact site with it. oh here anteros said. one can smell the very shape of the flint points already. two large points one small one. surely you get the whiff of them already four more hoe cuts and i come to them. four more hoe cuts and anteros did come to them. he uncovered two large points and one small one spearheads and arrowhead. lanceolate they were with ribbon flaking. they were late folsom or they were protoplano they were what you will. this cannot be steinleser groaned. theyre the missing chips the transition pieces. they fill the missing places too well. i wont believe it. id hardly believe it if mastodon bones were found on the same level here. in a moment said anteros beginning to use the hoe again. hey those old beasts did smell funny an elephant isnt in it with them. and a lot of it still clings to their bones. will a sixth thoracic bone do im pretty sure thats what it is. i dont know where the rest of the animal is. probably somebody gnawed the thoracic here. nine hoe cuts and then very careful. nine hoe cuts and then anteros using a masons trowel unearthed the old gnawed bone very carefully. yes howard said almost angrily it was a sixth thoracic of a mastodon. robert derby said it was a fifth or sixth it is not easy to tell. leave the digging for a while anteros steinleser said. i want to record and photograph and take a few measurements here.  a  terrence burdock and magdalen mobley were working at the bottom of the chimney rock at the bottom of the fluting that ran the whole height of it like a core sample. get anteros over here and see what he can uncover in sixty seconds terrence offered. oh him hell just uncover some of his own things. what do you mean his own things nobody could have made an  intrusion here. its hard sandstone. and harder flint here magdalen said. i might have known it. pass the damned thing up. i know just about what it says anyhow. what it says what do you mean but it is marked and its large and dressed rough. whod carve in flint somebody real stubborn just like flint magdalen said. all right then lets have it out. anteros get this out in one piece. and do it without shattering it or tumbling the whole thing down on us. he can do it you know terrence. he can do things like that. what do you know about his doings magdalen you never saw or heard about the poor man till last night. oh well i know that itll turn out to be the same damned stuff. anteros did get it out without shattering it or bringing down the chimney column. a cleft with a digging bar three sticks of the stuff and a cap and he touched the leads to the battery when he was almost on top of the charge. the blast it sounded as if the whole sky were falling down in them and some of those skyblocks were quite large stones. the ancients wondered why fallen pieces of the sky should always be dark rockstuff and never skyblue clear stuff. the answer is that it is only pieces of the night sky that ever fall even though they may sometimes be most of the daytime in falling such is the distance. and the blast that anteros set off did bring down rocky chunks of the night sky even though it was broad daylight. they brought down darker rocks than any of which the chimney was composed. still it was a small blast. the chimney tottered but did not collapse. it settled back uneasily on its base. and the flint block was out in the clear. a thousand spearheads and arrowheads could be shattered and chipped out of that hunk terrence marveled. that flint block would have been a primitive fortune for a primitive man. i had several such fortunes anteros said dully and this one i preserved and dedicated. they had all gathered around it. oh the poor man ethyl suddenly exclaimed but she was not looking at any of the men. she was looking at the stone. i wish hed get off that kick magdalen sputtered angrily. i dont care how rich he is. i can pick up better stuff than him in the alleys. what are the women chirping about terrence asked. but those do  look like true glyphs. almost like aztec are they not steinleser nahuattanoan cousinsgerman to the aztec or should i say cousins yaqui call it anything but can you read it probably. give me eight or ten hours on it and i should come up with a contingent reading of many of the glyphs. we can hardly expect a rational rendering of the message however. all nahuattanoan translations so far have been gibberish. and remember terrence that steinleser is a slow reader magdalen said spitefully. and he isnt very good at interpreting other signs either. steinleser was sullen and silent. how had his face come to bear those deep livid claw marks today they moved a lot of rock and rubble that morning took quite a few pictures wrote up bulky notes. there were constant finds as the divided party worked up the shagslash in the mound and the coreflute of the chimney. there were no more really startling discoveries no more turned pots of the protoplano period how could there be there were no more predicted and perfect points of the late folsom but there were broken and unpredictable points. no other mastodon thoracic was found but bones were uncovered of bison latifrons of dire wolf of coyote of man. there were some anomalies in the relationship of the things discovered but it was not as fishy as it had been in the early morning not as fishy as when anteros had announced and then dug out the shards of the pot the three points the mastodon bone. the things now were as authentic as they were expected and yet their very profusion had still the smell of a small fish. and that anteros was one digging man. he moved the sand he moved the stone he missed nothing. and at noon he disappeared. an hour later he reappeared in a glossy station wagon coming out of a thicketed ravine where no one would have expected a way. he had been to town. he brought a variety of cold cuts cheeses relishes and pastries a couple of cases of cold beer and some v.o. i thought you were a poor man anteros terrence chided. i told you that i was a rich old poor man. i have nine thousand acres of grassland i have three thousand head of cattle i have alfalfa land and clover land and corn land and haygrazer land oh knock it off magdalen snapped. i have other things anteros finished sullenly. they ate they rested they worked the afternoon. magdalen worked as swiftly and solidly as did anteros. she was young she was stocky she was lightburneddark. she was not at all beautiful ethyl was. she could have any man there any time she wanted to ethyl couldnt. she was magdalen the often unpleasant the mostly casual the suddenly intense one. she was the tension of the party the string of the bow. anteros she called sharply just at sundown. the turtle he asked. the turtle that is under the ledge out of the current where the backwater curls in reverse but he is fit and happy and he has never harmed anything except for food or fun. i know you do not want me to get that turtle. i do theres eighteen pounds of him. hes fat. hell be good. only eighty yards where the bank crumbles down to green river under the lower ledge thats shale that looks like slate two feet deep i know where he is. i will go get the fat turtle anteros said. i myself am the fat turtle. i am the green river. he went to get it. oh that damned poetry of his magdalen spat when he was gone. anteros brought back the fat turtle. he looked as if hed weigh twentyfive pounds but if magdalen said he weighed eighteen pounds then it was eighteen. start cooking ethyl magdalen said. magdalen was undergraduate girl permitted on the digging by sheer good fortune. the others of the party were all archeologists of the moment. magdalen had no right to give orders to anyone except her born right. i dont know how to cook a turtle ethyl complained. anteros will show you how. mere the late evening smell of newly exposed excavation terrence burdock burbled as they lounged around the campfire a little later full of turtle and v.o. and feeling rakishly wise. the exposed age can be guessed by the very  timbre of the smell i believe. timbre of the smell what is your nose wired up to from magdalen. and indeed there was something timeevocative about the smell of the diggings cool at the same time musty and musky ripe with old stratified water and compressed death. stratified time. it helps if you already know what the exposed age is said howard steinleser. here there is an anomaly. the chimney sometimes acts as if it were younger than the mound. the chimney cannot be young enough to include written rock but it is. archeology is made up entirely of anomalies said terrence rearranged to make them fit in a fluky pattern. thered be no system to it otherwise. every science is made up entirely of anomalies rearranged to fit said robert derby. have you unriddled the glyphstone howard yes pretty well better than i expected. charles august can verify it of course when we get it back to the university. it is a nonroyal nontribal nonwarfare nonhunt declaration. it does not come under any of the usual radical signs any of the categories. it can only be categorized as uncategorized or personal the translation will be rough. rocky is the word said magdalen. on with it howard ethyl cried. you are the freedom of wild pigs in the sourgrass and the nobility of badgers. you are the brightness of serpents and the soaring of vultures. you are passion of mesquite bushes on fire with lightning. you are serenity of toads. youve got to admit hes got a different line said ethyl. your own love notes were less acrid terrence. what kind of thing is it steinleser terrence questioned. it must have a category. i believe ethyl is right. its a love poem. you are the water in rock cisterns and the secret spiders in that water. you are the dead coyote lying half in the stream and you are the old entrapped dreams of the coyotes brains oozing liquid through the broken eye socket. you are the happy ravening flies about that broken socket. oh hold it steinleser robert derby cried. you cant have gotten all that from scratches on flint. what is entrapped dreamsin nahuattanoan » a glyphwriting the solidperson sign next to the hollowperson sign both enclosed in the night signthat has always been interpreted as the dream glyph. and here the dream glyph is enclosed in the glyph of the deadfall trap. yes i believe it means entrapped dreams. to continue you are the cornworm in the dark heart of the corn the naked small bird in the nest. you are the pustules on the sick rabbit devouring life and flesh and turning it into your own serum. you are stars compressed into charcoal. but you cannot give you cannot take. once again you will be broken at the foot of the cliff and the word will remain unsaid in your swollen and purple tongue. a love poem perhaps but with a difference said robert derby. i never was able to go his stuff and i tried i really tried magdalen moaned. here is the change of personsubject shown by the cantedeye glyph linked with the selfglyph steinleser explained. it is now a firstperson talk. i own tenthousand backloads of corn. i own gold and beans and nine buffalo horns full of watermelon seeds. i own the loin cloth that the sun wore on his fourth journey across the sky. only three loin cloths in the world are older and more valued than this. i cry out to you in a big voice like the hammering of herons that soundverbparticle is badly translated the hammer being not a modern pounding hammer but a rock angling chipping hammer and the belching of buffaloes. my love is sinewy as entwined snakes it is steadfast as the sloth it is like a feathered arrow shot into your abdomensuch is my love. why is my love unrequited i challenge you steinleser terrence burdock cut in. what is the glyph for unrequited the glyph of the extended handwith all the fingers bent backward. it goes on i roar to you. do not throw yourself down. you believe you are on the hanging sky bridge but you are on the terminal cliff. i grovel before you. i am no more than dogdroppings. youll notice he said that and not me magdalen burst out. there was always a fundamental incoherence about magdalen. ahcontinue steinleser said terrence. the girl is daft or she dreams out loud. that is all of the inscriptions terrence except for a final glyph which i dont understand. glyph writing takes a lot of room. thats all the stone a  a  would hold. what is the glyph that you dont understand howard its the spearthrower glyph entwined with the time glyph. it sometimes means flung forward or beyond. but what does it mean here it means continued dummy. continued magdalen said. do not fear. therell be more stories. i think its beautiful said ethyl burdock in its own context of course. then why dont you take him on ethyl in his own context of course magdalen asked. myself i dont care how many backloads of corn he owns. ive had it. take whom on dear ethyl asked. howard steinleser can interpret the stones but who can interpret our magdalen oh i can read her like a rock. terrence burdock smiled. but he couldnt. but it had fastened on them. it was all about them and through them the brightness of serpents and the serenity of toads the secret spiders in the water the entrapped dreams oozing through the broken eye socket the pustules of the sick rabbit the belching of the buffalo and the arrow shot into the abdomen. and around it all was the night smell of flint and turned earth and chuckling streams the mustiness and the special muskiness which bears the name nobility of badgers. they talked archeology and myth talk. then it was steep night and the morning of the third day. a oh the sample digging went well. this was already a richer mound than spiro though the gash in it was but a small promise of things to come. and the curious twin of the mound the broken chimney confirmed and confounded and contradicted. there was time going wrong in the chimney or at least in the curious fluted core of it the rest of it was normal enough and sterile enough. anteros worked that day with a soft sullenness and magdalen brooded with a sort of lightning about her. beads glass beads terrence burdock exploded angrily. all right who is the hoaxer in our midst i will not tolerate this at all. terrence had been angry of face all day. he was clawed deeply as steinleser had been the day before and he was sour on the world. there have been glassbead caches before terrence hundreds of them robert derby said softly. there have been hoaxers before hundreds of them terrence howled. these have hong kong contemporary written all over them damn cheap glass beads sold by the pound. they have no business in a stratum of around the year seven hundred. all right who is guilty i dont believe that any one of us is guilty terrence ethyl put in mildly. they are found four feet in from the slant surface of the mound. why weve cut through three hundred years of vegetable loam to get to them and certainly the surface was eroded beyond that. we are scientists said steinleser. we find these. others have found such. let us consider the improbabilities of it. it was noon so they ate and rested and considered the improbabilities. anteros had brought them a great joint of white pork and they made sandwiches and drank beer and ate pickles. you know said robert derby that beyond the rank impossibility of glass beads found so many times where they could not be found there is a real mystery about all early indian beads whether of bone stone or antler. there are millions and millions of these fine beads with pierced holes finer than any piercer ever found. there are residues there are centers of every other indian industry and there is evolution of every other tool. why have there been these millions of pierced beads and never one piercer there was no technique to make so fine a piercer. how were they done magdalen giggled. beadspitter she said. beadspitter youre out of your fuzzy mind terrence erupted. thats the silliest and least sophisticated of all indian legends. but it is the legend said robert derby the legend of more than thirty separate tribes. the carib indians of cuba said that they got their beads from beadspitters. the indians of panama told balboa the same thing. the indians of the pueblos told the same story to coronado. every indian community had an indian who was its beadspitter. there are creek and alabama and koasati stories of beadspitter see swantons collections. and his stories were taken down within living memory. more than that when european tradebeads were first introduced there is one account of an indian receiving some and saying i will take some to beadspitter. if he sees them he can spit them too. and that beadspitter did then spit them by the bushel. there was never any other indian account of the origin of their beads. all were spit by a beadspitter. really this is very unreal ethyl said. really it was. hog hokey a beadspitter of around the year seven hundred could not spit future beads he could not spit cheap hong kong glass beads of the present time terrence was very angry. pardon me yes sir he could said anteros. a beadspitter can spit future beads if he faces north when he spits. that has always been known. terrence was angry he fumed and poisoned the day for them and the claw marks on his face stood out livid purple. he was angrier yet when he said that the curious dark capping rock on top of the chimney was dangerous that it would fall and kill someone and anteros said that there was no such capping rock on the chimney that terrences eyes were deceiving him that terrence should go sit in the shade and rest. and terrence became excessively angry when he discovered that magdalen was trying to hide something that she had discovered in the fluted core of the chimney. it was a large and heavy shalestone too heavy even for magdalens puzzling strength. she had dragged it out of the chimney flute tumbled it down to the bottom and was trying to cover it with rocks and scarp. robert mark the extraction point terrence called loudly. its quite plain yet. magdalen stop that whatever it is it must be examined now. oh its just more of the damned same thing i wish hed let me alone. with his kind of money he can get plenty of girls. besides its private terrence. you dont have any business reading it. you are hysterical magdalen and you may have to leave the digging site. i wish i could leave. i cant. i wish i could love. i cant. why isnt it enough that i die howard spend the afternoon on this terrence ordered. it has writing of a sort on it. if its what i think it is it scares me. its too recent to be in any eroded chimney rock formation howard and it comes from far below the top. read it. a few hours on it and i may come up with something. i never saw anything like it either. what did you think it was terrence what do you think i think it is its much later than the other and that one was impossible. ill not be the one to confess myself crazy first.  howard steinleser went to work on the incised stone and two hours before sundown they brought him another one a gray soapstone block from higher up. whatever this was covered with it was not at all the same thing that covered the shalestone. and elsewhere things went well too well. the old fishiness was back on it. no series of finds could be so perfect no petrification could be so well ordered. robert magdalen called down to robert derby just at sunset in the high meadow above the shore about four hundred yards down just past the old fence line there is a badger hole magdalen. now you have me doing it seeing invisible things at a distance. and if i take a carbine and stroll down there quietly the badger will stick his head out just as i get there i being strongly downwind of him and ill blam him between the eyes. hell be a big one fifty pounds. thirty. bring him robert. youre showing a little understanding at last. but magdalen badger is rampant meat. its seldom eaten. may not the condemned girl have what she wishes for her last meal go get it robert. robert went. the voice of the little carbine was barely heard at that distance. soon robert brought back the dead badger. cook it ethyl magdalen ordered. yes i know. and if i dont know how anteros will show me. but anteros was gone. robert found him on a sundown knoll with his shoulders hunched. the old man was sobbing silently and his face seemed to be made out of dull pumice stone. but he came back to aid ethyl in preparing the  badger. if the first of todays stones scared you the second should have lifted the hair right off your head terrence howard steinleser said. it does it does. all the stones are too recent to be in a chimney formation but this last one is an insult. it isnt two hundred years old but theres a thousand years of strata above it. what time is deposited here they had eaten rampant badger meat and drunk inferior whiskey which anteros who had given it to them didnt know was inferior and the muskiness was both inside them and around them. the campfire sometimes spit angrily with small explosions and its glare reached high when it did so. by one such leaping glare terrence burdock saw that the curious dark capping rock was once more on top of the chimney. he thought he had seen it there in the daytime but it had not been there after he had sat in the shade and rested and it had absolutely not been there when he climbed the chimney itself to be sure. lets have the second chapter and then the third howard ethyl said. its neater that way. yes. well the second chapter the first and lowest and apparently the earliest rock we came on today is written in a language that no one ever saw written before and yet its no great trouble to read it. even terrence guessed what it was and it scared him. it is anadarkocaddo handtalk graven in stone. it is what is called the sign language of the plains indians copied down in formalized pictographs. and it has to be very recent within the last three hundred years. handtalk was fragmentary at the first coming of the spanish and well developed at the first coming of the french. it was an explosive development as such things go worked out within a hundred years. this rock has to be younger than its situs but it was absolutely found in place. read it howard read it robert derby called. robert was feeling fine and the rest of them were gloomy tonight. i own three hundred ponies steinleser read the rock out of his memory. i own two days ride north and east and south and one days ride west. i give you all. i blast out with a big voice like fire in tall trees like the explosion of crowning pine trees. i cry like closingin wolves like the high voice of the lion like the hoarse scream of torn calves. do you not destroy yourself again you are the dew on crazyweed in the morning. you are the swift crooked wings of the nighthawk the dainty feet of the skunk you are the juice of the sour squash. why can you not take or give i am the hump backed bull of the high plains i am the river itself and the stagnant pools left by the river i am the raw earth and the rocks. come to me but do not come so violently as to destroy yourself. ah that was the text of the first rock of the day the anadarkocaddo handtalk graven in stone. and final pictographs which i dont understand a shotarrow sign and a boulder beyond. continued on next rock of course said robert derby. well why wasnt handtalk ever written down the signs are simple and easily stylized and they were understood by many different tribes. it would have been natural to write it. alphabetical writing was in the region before handtalk was well developed terrence burdock said. in fact it was the coming of the spanish that gave the impetus to handtalk. it was really developed for communication between spanish and indian not between indian and indian. and yet i believe handtalk was written down once it was the beginning of the chinese pictographs. and there also it had its beginning as communication between differing peoples. depend on it if all mankind had always been of a single language there would never have been any written language developed at all. writing always began as a bridge and there had to be some chasm for it to bridge. we have one to bridge here said steinleser. that whole chimney is full of rotten smoke. the highest part of it should be older than the lowest part of the mound since the mound was built on a base eroded away from the chimney formation. but in many ways they seem to be contemporary. we must all be under a spell here. weve worked two days on this parts of three days and the total impossibility of the situation hasnt struck us yet. the old nahuatlan glyphs for time are the chimney glyphs. present time is a lower part of a chimney and fire burning at the base. past time is black smoke from a chimney and future time is white smoke from a chimney. there was a signature glyph running through our yesterdays stone which i didnt and dont understand. it seemed to indicate something coming down out of the chimney rather than going up it. it really doesnt look much like a chimney magdalen said. and a maiden doesnt look much like dew on crazyweed in the morning magdalen robert derby said but we recognize these identities. a   they talked a while about the impossibility of the whole business. there are scales on our eyes steinleser said. the fluted core of the chimney is wrong. im not even sure the rest of the chimney is right. no it isnt said robert derby. we can identify most of the strata of the chimney with known periods of the river and stream. i was above and below today. there is one stretch where the sandstone was not eroded at all where it stands three hundred yards back from the shifted river and is overlaid with a hundred years of loam and sod. there are other sections where the stone is cut away variously. we can tell when most of the chimney was laid down we can find its correspondences up to a few hundred years ago. but when were the top ten feet of it laid down there were no correspondences anywhere to that. the centuries represented by the strata of the top of the chimney people those centuries havent happened yet. and when was the dark capping rock on top of it all formed terrence began. ah im out of my mind. it isnt there. im demented. no more than the rest of us said steinleser. i saw it too i thought today. and then i didnt see it again. the rockwriting its like an old novel that i only half remember said ethyl. oh thats what it is yes magdalen murmured. but i dont remember what happened to the girl in it. i remember what happened to her ethyl magdalen said. give us the third chapter howard ethyl asked. i want to see how it comes out. first you should all have whiskey for those colds anteros suggested humbly. but none of us have colds ethyl objected. you take your own medicinal advice ethyl and ill take mine terrence said. i will have whiskey. my cold is not rheum but fearchill.   they all had whiskey. they talked a while and some of them dozed. its late howard ethyl said after a while. lets have the next chapter. is it the last chapter then well sleep. we have honest digging to do tomorrow. our third stone our second stone of the day just past is another and even later form of writing and it has never been seen in stone before. it is kiowa picture writing. the kiowas did their outturning spiral writing on buffalo skins dressed almost as fine as vellum. in its more sophisticated form and this is a copy of that it is quite late. the kiowa picture writing probably did not arrive at its excellence until influenced by white artists. how late steinleser robert derby asked. not more than a hundred and fifty years old. but i have never seen it copied in stone before. it simply isnt stonestyled. theres a lot of things around here lately that i havent seen before. well then to the text or should i say the pictography you fear the earth you fear rough ground and rocks you fear moister earth and rotting flesh you fear the flesh itself all flesh is rotting flesh. if you love not rotting flesh you love not at all. you believe the bridge hanging in the sky the bridge hung by tendrils and woody vines that diminish as they go up and up till they are no thicker than hairs. there is no skybridge you cannot go up on it. did you believe that the roots of love grow upside down they come out of deep earth that is old flesh and brains and hearts and entrails that is old buffalo bowels and snakes pizzles that is black blood and rot and moaning underground. this is old and wornout and bloody time and the roots of love grow out of its gore. you seem to give remarkably detailed translations of the simple spiral pictures steinleser but i begin to get in the mood of it terrence said. ah perhaps i cheat a little said steinleser. you lie a lot magdalen challenged. no i do not. there is some basis for every phrase ive used. it goes on i own twentytwo trade rifles. i own ponies. i own mexico silver eightbit pieces. i am rich in all ways. i give all to you. i cry out with big voice like a i bear full of madweed like a bullfrog in love like a stallion rearing against a puma. it is the earth that calls you. i am the earth woolier than wolves and rougher than rocks. i am the bog earth that sucks you in. you cannot give you cannot like you cannot love you think there is something else you think   a there is a skybridge you may loiter on without crashing down. i am bristled boar earth there is no other. you will come to me in the morning. you will come to me easy and with grace. or you will come to me reluctant and you be shattered in every bone and member of you. you be broken by our encounter. you be shattered as by a lightning bolt striking up from the earth. i am the red calf which is in the writings. i am the rotting red earth. live in the morning or die in the morning but remember that love in death is better than no love at all. oh brother nobody gets that stuff from such kid pictures steinleser robert derby moaned. ah well thats the end of the spiral picture. and a kiowa spiral pictograph ends with either an insweep or an outsweep line. this ends with an outsweep which means continued on next rock thats what it means terrence cried roughly. you wont find the next rocks magdalen said. theyre hidden and most of the time theyre not there yet but they will go on and on. but for all that youll read it in the rocks tomorrow morning. i want it to be over with. oh i dont know what i want i believe i know what you want tonight magdalen robert derby said. but he didnt. the talk trailed off the fire burned down they went to their sleeping sacks. then it was long jagged night and the morning of the fourth day. but wait in nahuattanoan legend the world ends on the fourth morning. all the lives we lived or thought we lived had been but dreams of third night. the loin cloth that the sun wore on the fourth days journey was not so valuable as one has made out. it was worn for no more than an hour or so. and in fact there was something terminal about fourth morning. anteros had disappeared. magdalen had disappeared. the chimney rock looked greatly diminished in its bulk something had gone out of it and much crazier in its broken height. the sun had come up a garish grayorange color through fog. the signatureglyph of the first stone dominated the ambient. it was as if something were coming down from the chimney a horrifying smoke but it was only noisome morning fog. no it wasnt. there was something else coming down from the chimney or from the hidden sky pebbles stones indescribable bits of foul oozings the less fastidious pieces of sky a light nightmare rain had begun to fall there the chimney was apparently beginning to crumble. its the damnedest thing i ever heard about robert derby growled. do you think that magdalen really went off with anteros derby was bitter and fumatory this morning and his face was badly clawed. who is magdalen who is anteros ethyl burdock risked. terrence burdock was hooting from high on the mound. all come up he called. here is a find that will make it all worthwhile. well have to photo and sketch and measure and record and witness. its the finest basalt head ive ever seen mansized and i suspect that theres a mansized body attached to it. well soon clean it and clear it. gah what a weird fellow he was but howard steinleser was studying a brightly colored something that he held in his two hands. what is it howard what are you doing derby demanded. ah i believe this is the next stone in the sequence. the writing is alphabetical but deformedthere is an element missing. i believe it is in modern english and i will solve the deformity and see it true in a minute. the text of it seems to be rocks and stones were coming down from the chimney and fog amnesic and witstealing fog. steinleser are you all right robert derby asked with compassion. that isnt a stone that you hold in your hand. it isnt a stone i thought it was. what is it then it is the fruit of the osage orange tree an american moraceous. it isnt a stone howard. and the thing was a tough woody wrinkled mockorange as big as a small melon. you have to admit that the wrinkles look a little bit like writing robert. yes they look a little like writing howard. let us go up where terrence is bawling for us. youve read too many stones. and it isnt safe here. why go up robert the other thing is coming down. it was the bristledboar earth reaching up with a rumble. it was a lightning bolt struck upward out of the earth and it got its prey. there was explosion and roar. the dark capping rock was jerked from the top of the chimney and a slammed with terrible force to the earth shattering with a great shock. and something else that had been on that capping rock. and the whole chimney collapsed about them. she was broken by the encounter. she was shattered in every bone and member of her. and she was dead. whowho is she howard steinleser stuttered. oh god magdalen of course robert derby cried. i remember her a little bit. didnt understand her. she put out like an evoking moth but she wouldnt be had. near clawed the face off me the other night when i misunderstood the signals. she believed there was a skybridge. its in a lot of the mythologies. but there isnt one you know. oh well. the girl is dead damnation what are you doing grubbing in those stones maybe she isnt dead in them yet robert. im going to read whats here before something happens to them. this capping rock that fell and broke its impossible of course. its a stratum that hasnt been laid down yet. i always did want to read the future and i may never get another chance. you fool the girls dead does nobody care terrence stop bellowing about your find. come down. the girls dead. come up robert and howard terrence insisted. leave that broken stuff down there. its worthless. but nobody ever saw anything like this. do come up men ethyl sang. oh its a wonderful piece i never saw anything like it in my life.  ethyl is the whole morning mad robert derby demanded as he came up to her. shes dead. dont you really remember her dont you remember magdalen im not sure. is she the girl down there isnt she the same girl whos been hanging around here a couple of days she shouldnt have been playing on that high rock. im sorry shes dead. but just look what were uncovering here terrence. dont you remember magdalen the girl down there shes a little bit like the girl that clawed the hell out of me the other night. next time someone goes to town they might mention to the sheriff that theres a dead girl here. robert did you ever see a face like this one and it digs away to reveal the shoulders. i believe theres a whole mansized figure here. wonderful wonderful terrence youre off your head. well do you remember anteros certainly the twin of eros but nobody ever made much of the symbol of unsuccessful love. thunder thats the name for him it fits him perfectly. well call him anteros. well it was anteros lifelike in basalt stone. his face was contorted. he was sobbing soundlessly and frozenly and his shoulders were hunched with emotion. the carving was fascinating in its miserable passion his stony love unrequited. perhaps he was more impressive now than he would be when he was cleaned. he was earth he was earth itself. whatever period the carving belonged to it was outstanding in its power. the live anteros terrence. dont you remember our digging man anteros manypenny sure. he didnt show up for work this morning did he tell him hes fired. magdalen is dead she was one of us dammit she was the main one of us robert derby cried. terrence and ethyl burdock were earless to his outburst. they were busy uncovering the rest of the carving. and down below howard steinleser was studying dark broken rocks before they would disappear studying a stratum that hadnt been laid down yet reading a foggy future. to ask how any story or tune or statue comes about is to ask how is it done what does it take have you heard of the dutch boy in this country who was going to butcher school whose schoolmates tried to mix him up the heart they told him that is named the liver the bladder is called the stomach the tongue is the coccyx the loin is known as the chuck the brisket is the flank the lungs are named the trotters and so on. this dutch kid was very smart however he figured out that they were having him and he figured out the right names for everything or for almost everything. and how i wrote continued on next rock an afterword by r. a. lafferty he passed his final examination with top grades both in meatcutting and nomenclature. how were you able to do it the instructor asked with so many things going against you ive got it up there the dutch kid said and he tapped his head. kidneys. it isnt exactly that one should use kidneys for brains but the sense of grotesque juxtaposition does come in handy. you cant be sure you are looking at something from the right angle till you have looked at it from every angle. how did i write continued on next rock then upside down and backward of course. i started with a simple but i believe novel idea that had to do with time. then i involuted the idea of time making all things contemporary or at least repeating and i turned the systems of values backward trying to make the repulsive things appear poetic the nobility of badgers the serenity of toads and trying to set antilove up as comparable to love the flattest thing you can imagine has to have at least two sides it can have many more. i let the characters that had been generated by this action work out their own way then. after this i subtracted the original simple but novel idea from the story and finished things up. the original idea was a catalyst which could be recovered practically unchanged at the end of the reaction. the beginning idea which i give to anyone who wants it was simply to have archeologists digging upward through certain strata for rather vague topographic reasons come to deposits of the fairly recent past or the very recent past of the near future a discarded license plate from fifteen years in the future for instance then the more distant future then to realize that the strata still remaining above them had to contain the remnants of at least a hundred thousand years of unfaked future. so much for the genesis of one particular short story. each one is different but each one is anomalous and there is a reason for that. no normal or reasonable or balanced or welladjusted person is going to attempt the making of a story or a tune or a statue or a poem hell have no need for such abnormal activity. a person has to be somehow deficient or lacking in person or

and donates to the healthy world for its use the healthy world having only the vaguest idea that it even needs crutches. there are i know many apparent glaring exceptions to the rule that only persons

written word here. reading an r. a. lafferty story is always a bit of a trippy experiencea journey into the odder parts of experience his perceptively askew perspective a looking glass all its own. but sky is about an actual trip or a few of them with all the inspired psychedelia and questionable reality we expect and desirefrom a lafferty story. the titles sky isnt the airy horizon above us. no its the unusual substance sold by the furryhanded skyseller who cant survive in sunlight or thinks he cant anyway to ostensible main character welkin alauda. a 1972 hugo nominee sky sits at the intersection of the absurd and the transcendental. there are deadpan assurances of fantastical dangers you will burn welkin told him. nobody burns so as when sunning himself on a cloud. there is the observational commentary of some unseen but nonetheless present narrator on both the characters and the grim world that surrounds them of welkin were told it was said that her bones were hollow and filled with air. the skydiving friends of welkin discuss time and the universe existence and falls through it in perfect rosecolored stoner parlance. we sense the end of a journey coming as we read and we know it will be quite a crash. welkin wanders through caverns filled with amanita mushroom varieties deadly and hallucinogenic gathered by not just the sky seller but moles. the results that follow this final trip linger with the reader. so enjoy this delightful trance of a tale but always remember sky has its dangers. introduction by gwenda bond sky the skyseller was mr. furtive himself foxmuzzled ferreteyed slithering along like a snake and living under the rocks. the rocks had not been a grand place for a long time. it had been built in the grand style on a mephitic plot of earth to transform it but the mephitic earth had won out. the apartments of the rocks had lost their sparkle as they had been divided again and again and now they were shoddy. the rocks had weathered. its once pastel hues were now dull grays and browns. the five underground levels had been parking places for motor vehicles when those were still common but now these depths were turned into warrens and hovels. the skyseller lurked and lived in the lowest and smallest and meanest of them all. he came out only at night. daylight would have killed him he knew that. he sold out of the darkest shadows of the night. he had only a few though oddly select clients and nobody knew who his supplier was. he said that he had no supplier that he gathered and made the stuff himself. welkin alauda a fullbodied but lightmoving girl it was said that her bones were hollow and filled with air came to the skyseller just before first light just when he had become highly nervous but had not yet bolted to his underground. a sack of sky from the nervous mouse. jump or the sun will gobble your house welkin sangsong and she was already higher than most skies. hurry hurry the skyseller begged thrusting the sack to her while his black eyes trembled and glittered if real light should ever reflect into them hed go blind. sky » welkin took the sack of sky and scrambled money notes into his hands which had furred palms. really yes really. world be flat and the air be round wherever the sky grows underground welkin intoned taking the sack of sky and soaring along with a light scamper of feet she hadnt much weight her bones were hollow. and the skyseller darted headfirst down a black wellshaft thing to his depths. four of them went skydiving that morning welkin herself karl vlieger icarus riley joseph alzarsi and the pilot wasno not who you think he had already threatened to turn them all in theyd use that pilot no morethe pilot was ronald kolibri in his little cropdusting plane. but a cropduster will not go up to the frosty heights they liked to take off from. yes it willif everybody is on sky. but it isnt pressurized and it doesnt carry oxygen. that doesnt matter not if everybody is on sky not if the plane is on sky too. welkin took sky with mountain whizz a carbonated drink. karl stuffed it into his lip like snuff. icarus riley rolled it and smoked it. joseph alzarsi needled it mixed with drinking alcohol into his main vein. the pilot ronny tongued and chewed it like sugar dust. the plane named shrike took it through the manifold. fifty thousand feetyou cant go that high in a cropduster. thirty below zeroah that isnt cold air too thin to breathe at allwith sky who needs such included things as air welkin stepped out and went up not down. it was a trick she often pulled. she hadnt much weight she could always get higher than the rest of them. she went up and up until she disappeared. then she drifted down again completely enclosed in a sphere of ice crystal sparkling inside it and making monkey faces at them. the wind yelled and barked and the divers took off. they all went down soaring and gliding and tumbling standing still sometimes it seemed even rising again a little. they went down to clouds and spread out on them dark white clouds with the sun inside them and suffusing them both from above and below. they cracked welkins icecrystal sphere and she stepped out of it. they ate the thin pieces of it very cold and brittle and with a tang of ozone. alzarsi took off his shirt and sunned himself on a cloud. you will burn welkin told him. nobody burns so as when sunning himself on a cloud. that was true. they sank through the blackwhiteness of these clouds and came into the limitless blue concourse with clouds above and below them. it was in this same concourse that hippodameia used to race her horses there not being room for such coursers to run on earth. the clouds below folded up and the clouds above folded down forming a discrete space. we have our own rotundity and sphere here said icarus riley these are their skydiver names not their legal names and it is apart from all worlds and bodies. the worlds and bodies do not exist for as long a time as we say that they do not exist. the axis of our present space is its own concord. therefore it being in perfect concord time stops. all their watches had stopped at least. but there is a world below said karl. it is an abject world and we can keep it abject forever if we wish. but it has at least a shadowy existence and later we will let it fill out again in our compassion for lowly things. it is flat though and we must insist that it remain flat. this is important joseph said with the deep importance of one on sky. so long as our own space is bowed and globed the world must remain flat or depressed. but the world must not be allowed to bow its back again. we are in danger if it ever does. so long as it is truly flat and abject it cannot crash ourselves to it. how long could we fall welkin asked if we had not stopped time if we let it flow at its own pace or at ours how long could we fall hephaestus once tumbled through space all day long icarus riley said and the days were longer then. karl vlieger had gone walleyed from an interiorturned sexual passion that he often experienced in diving. icarus riley seemed to be on laughing gas suddenly this is a sign that sky is not having a perfect effect. joseph alzarsi felt a cold wind down his spine and a series of jerky little premonitions. we are not perfect joseph said. tomorrow or the next day we may be for we do approach perfection. we win a round. and we win another. let us not throw away our victory today through carelessness. the earth has bowed  his old back a little bit and we make ready for him now guys now four of them or maybe only three of them pulled the rings. the chutes unpeeled flowered and jerked. they had been together like a sheaf in close conversation. but suddenly on coming to earth they were spread out over five hundred yards. they assembled. they packed their chutes. that would be all the diving for that day. welkin how did you pack your chute so quickly icarus asked her suspiciously. i dont know. you are always the slowest one of us and the sloppiest. someone always has to reroll your chute for you before it is used again. and you were the last one to land just now. how were you the first one to be packed how did you roll it so well it has the earmarks of my own rolling just as i rolled it for you before we took off this morning. i dont know icarus. oh i think ill go up again straight up. no youve sailed and dived enough for one morning. welkin did you even open your chute i dont know.   high on sky they went up again the next morning. the little plane named shrike flew up as no plane had ever flown before up through storm. the stormshrouded earth shrank to the size of a peadoogie. we will play a trick on it said welkin. when youre on sky you can play a trick on anything and make it abide by it. i will say that the peadoogie that was the world is nothing. see it is gone. then i will select another pea doogie that one there and i will call it the world. and that is the world that we will come down to in a little while. ive switched worlds on the world and it doesnt know what happened to it. its uneasy though joseph alzarsi spoke through flared nostrils. you shook it. no wonder the world has its moments of selfdoubt. they were one million feet high. the altimeter didnt go that high but ronald kolibri the pilot wrote out the extended figure in chalk to make it correct. welkin stepped out. karl and icarus and joseph stepped out. ronald kolibri stepped out but only for a while. then he remembered that he was the pilot and got back in the plane. they were so high that the air was black and starfilled instead of blue. it was so cold that the empty space was full of cracks and potholes. they dived half a million feet in no time at all. they pulled up laughing. it was invigorating it was vivifying. they stamped on the clouds and the clouds rang like frosty ground. this was the ancestral country of all hoarfrost of all grainedsnow and glareice. here was weathermaker here was wind son. they came into caves of ice mixed with moraine they found antler hatchets and hemicyon bones they found coals still glowing. the winds bayed and hunted in packs through the chasms. these were the cold fortean clouds and their location is commonly quite high. they came down below storm finding new sun and new air. it was pumpkinsummer it was deep autumn in the sky. they dropped again miles and millennia to full skysummer the air so blue that it grew a violet patina on it to save the surface. their own space formed about them again as it did every day and time stopped. but not motion motion never stopped with them. do you realize that nothingness in a void can still be in motion and how much more they of the great centrality there was dynamic there was sustaining vortex there was the high serenity of fevered motion. but is not motion merely a relationship of space to time no. that is an idea that is common to people who live on worlds but it is a subjective idea. here beyond the possible influence of any worlds there was living motion without reference. welkin you look quite different today joseph alzarsi spoke in wonder. what is it i dont know. its wonderful to be different and im wonderful. it is something missing from you said icarus. i believe it is a defect missing. but i hadnt any icarus. they were in central and eternal moment and it did not end it could not end it goes on yet. whatever else seems to happen it is merely in parentheses to that moment. it is time to consider again icarus mused after a while. there is no time or while in the moment but there is in the parentheses. i hope it is the last a time we will ever have to consider. we of course are in our own space and beyond time or tangent. but the earth such as it is is approaching with great presumption and speed. but its nothing to us karl vlieger suddenly raged out in a chthonic and phallic passion. we can shatter it we can shoot it to pieces like a clay pigeon it cannot rush onto us like a slashing dog. get down world heel you cur heel i say we say to one world rise and it rises and to another one heel and it heels icarus skyspoke in his dynamic serenity. not yet joseph alzarsi warned. tomorrow we will be total. today we are not yet. possibly we could shatter the world like a clay pigeon if we wished but we would not be lords of it if we had to shatter it. we could always make another world said welkin reasonably. certainly but this one is our testing. we will go to it when it is crouched down. we cannot allow it to come ravening to us. hold hold there we order you and the uprushing world halted cowed. we go down said joseph. we will let it come up only when it is properly broken. and they inclined the heavens and came down. once more three of them pulled the rings. and the chutes unpeeled flowered and jerked. they had been like a sheaf together in their moment but now coming to earth they were suddenly scattered out over five hundred yards. welkin you didnt have your chute at all today icarus gaped with some awe when they had assembled again. that is what was different about you. no i guess i didnt have it. there was no reason to have it if i didnt i need it. really there was never any reason for me to have used one at all ever. ah we were total today and didnt know it joseph ventured. tomorrow none of us will wear chutes. this is easier than i had believed.  a welkin went to the skyseller to buy new sky that night. not finding him in the nearer shadows of the rocks she went down and down drawn by the fungoid odor and the echoing dampness of the underground. she went through passages that were manmade through passages that were natural through passages that were unnatural. some of these corridors it is true had once been built by men but now they had reverted and became most unnatural deepearth caverns. welkin went down into the total blackness where there were certain small things that still mumbled out a faint white color but it was the wrong color white and the things were all of a wrong shape. there was the dead white shape of mycelium masses the grotesqueness of agaricus the deformity of deadly amanita and of morel. the graymilky lactarius glowed like lightless lanterns in the dark there was the bluewhite of the deceiving clitocybe and the yellowwhite of the caesar agaric. there was the insane ghostwhite of the deadliest and queerest of them all the fly amanita and a mole was gathering this. mole bring sky for the thing serene for the minions tall and the airy queen welkin jangled. she was still high on sky but it had begun to leave her a little and she had the veriest touch of the desolate sickness. sky for the queen of the buzzing drones with her hollow heart and her hollow bones the skyseller intoned hollowly. and fresh oh i want it fresh fresh sky welkin cried. with these creatures there is no such thing as fresh the skyseller told her. you want it stale oh so stale ingrown and aged and with its own mold grown moldy. which is it welkin demanded. what is the name of the one you gather it from the fly amanita. but isnt that simply a poisonous mushroom it has passed beyond that. it has sublimated. its simple poison has had its second fermenting into narcotic. but it sounds so cheap that it be merely narcotic. not merely narcotic. it is something very special in narcotic. no no not narcotic at all welkin protested. it is liberating it is world shattering. it is height absolute. it is motion and detachment itself. it is the ultimate. it is mastery. why then it is mastery lady. it is the highest and lowest of all created things. no no welkin protested again not created. it is not born it is not made. i couldnt stand that. it is the highest of all uncreated things. take it take it the skyseller growled and be gone. something begins to curl up inside me. i go welkin said and i will be back many times for more. no you will not be. nobody ever comes back many times for sky. you will be back never. or one time. i think that you will be back one time.  they went up again the next morning the last morning. but why should we say that it was the last morning because there would no longer be divisions or days for them. it would be one last eternal day for them now and nothing could break it. they went up in the plane that had once been named shrike and was now named eternal eagle. the plane had repainted itself during the night with new name and new symbols some of them not immediately understandable. the plane snuffled sky into its manifolds and grinned and roared. and the plane went up oh jerusalem in the sky how it went up they were all certainly perfect now and would never need sky again. they were sky. how little the world is welkin rang out. the towns are like flyspecks and the cities are like flies. it is wrong that so ignoble a creature as the fly should have the exalted name icarus complained. ill fix that welkin sang. i give edict that all the flies on earth be dead and all the flies on earth died in that instant. i wasnt sure you could do that said joseph alzarsi. the wrong is righted. now we ourselves assume the noble name of flies. there are no  flies but us the five of them including the pilot ronald kolibri stepped chuteless out of the eternal eagle. will you be all right ronald asked the rollicking plane. certainly the plane said. i believe i know where there are other eternal eagles. i will mate. it was cloudless or else they had developed the facility of seeing through clouds. or perhaps it was that the earth having become as small as a marble the clouds around it were insignificant. pure light that had an everywhere source the sun also had become insignificant and didnt contribute much to the light. pure and intense motion that had no location reference. they werent going anywhere with their intense motion they already were everywhere or at the supercharged center of everything. pure cold fever. pure serenity. impure hyperspace passion of karl vlieger and then of all of them but it was purely rampant at least. stunning beauty in all things along with a towering cragginess that was just ugly enough to create an ecstasy. welkin alauda was mythic with nenuphars in her hair. and it shall not be told what joseph alzarsi wore in his own hair. an alwaysinstant a million or a billion years not monotony no presentation living sets scenery the scenes were formed for the splinter of a moment or they were formed forever. whole worlds formed in a pregnant void not spherical worlds merely but dodeka spherical and those much more intricate than that. not merely seven colors to play with but seven to the seventh and to the seventh again. stars vivid in the bright light. you who have seen stars only in darkness be silent asteroids that they ate like peanuts for now they were all metamorphic giants. galaxies like herds of rampaging elephants. bridges so long that both ends of them receded over the lightspeed edges. waterfalls of a finer water that bounced off galaxy clusters as if they were boulders. through a certain ineptitude of handling welkin extinguished the old sun with one such leaping torrent. it does not matter icarus told her. either a million or a billion years had passed according to the timescale of the bodies and surely the sun had already come onto dim days. you can always make other suns. karl vlieger was casting lightning bolts millions of parsecs long and making looping contact with clustered galaxies with them. are you sure that we are not using up any time welkin asked them with some apprehension. oh time still uses itself up but we are safely out of the reach of it all joseph explained. time is only one very inefficient method of counting numbers. it is inefficient because it is limited in its numbers and because the counter by such a system must die when he has come to the end of his series. that alone should weigh against it as a mathematical system it really shouldnt be taught. then nothing can hurt us ever welkin wanted to be reassured. no nothing can come at us except inside time and we are outside it. nothing can collide with us except in space and we disdain space. stop it karl as you do it thats buggery. i have a worm in my own tract and it gnaws at me a little the pilot ronald kolibri said. its in my internal space and its crunching along at a pretty good rate. no no thats impossible. nothing can reach or hurt us joseph insisted. i have a worm of my own in a still more interior tract said icarus the tract that they never quite located in the head or the heart or the bowels. maybe this tract always was outside space. oh my worm doesnt gnaw but it stirs. maybe im tired of being out of reach of everything. where do these doubts rise from joseph sounded querulous. you hadnt them an instant ago you hadnt them as recently as ten million years ago. how can you have them now when there isnt any now well as to that icarus beganand a million years went byas to that i have a sort of cosmic curiosity about an object in my own past another million years went byan object called world. well satisfy your curiosity then karl vlieger snapped. dont you even know how to make a world certainly i know how but will it be the same yes if youre good enough. it will be the same if you make it the same. icarus riley made a world. he wasnt very good at it and it wasnt quite the same but it did resemble the old world a little.  a i want to see if some things are still there welkin clamored. bring it closer. its unlikely your things are still there joseph said remember that billions of years may have passed. the things will be there if i put them there icarus insisted. and you cannot bring it closer since all distance is now infinite karl maintained. at least i can focus it better icarus insisted and he did. the world appeared quite near. it remembers us like a puppy would welkin said. see it jumps up at us. its more like a lion leaping for a treed hunter just out of reach icarus grudged. but we are not treed. it cant ever reach us and it wants to welkin piqued. lets reach down to it. and they inclined the heavens and went down. a most peculiar thing happened to ronald kolibri as he touched earth. he seemed to have a seizure. he went slackfaced almost horrorfaced and he would not answer the others. what is it ronald welkin begged in kindred anguish. oh what is it somebody help him then ronald kolibri did an even more peculiar thing. he began to fold up and break up from the bottom. bones slowly splintered and pierced out of him and his entrails gushed out. he compressed. he shattered. he splashed. can a man splash the same sort of seizure overtook karl vlieger the identical slackface horrorface the same folding up and breaking up from the bottom the same hideous sequence. and joseph alzarsi went into the same sundering state baffled and breaking up. icarus whats happened to them welkin screamed. what is the slow loud booming theyre dead. how could that be icarus puzzled trembling. death is in time and we are not. icarus himself passed through time as he crashed earth breaking up spilling out more odiously than any of them. and welkin touched earth crashed then what she heard her own slow loud booming as she hit. another million years went by or some weeks. a shaky old woman on crutches was going down the middleofthenight passages that are under the rocks. she was too old a woman to be welkin alauda but not too old for a welkin who had lived millions of years outside of time. she had not died. she was lighter than the others and besides she had done it twice before unscathed. but that was before she had known fear. naturally they had told her that she would never walk again and now most unnaturally she was walking with crutches. drawn by the fungoid odor and the echoing dampness she went down in the total dark to where small things were growing with the wrong color white and were all of the wrong shape. she wanted one thing only and she would die without it. sky for salving the broken crone sky for the weal of my hollow bone she crackled in an oldwoman voice. but it was only her own voice that echoed back to her. should a skyseller live forever cliffs that laughed introduction by gregory feeley cliffs that laughed appeared in the march 1969 issue of magazine of horror surely one of laffertys less likely markets it was edited by robert a. w. lowndes who had published some of laffertys earliest stories and who doubtless knew enough to ask for more. it was reprinted in laffertys second collection 1972s strange doings but has scarcely been seen since. it certainly cannot be called a horror story although what freud called the horror of incest definitely plays a role. but what kind of story is it its a tale told in a bar at least in partbut interleaved with another tale told decades earlier to the same narrator by a malay storyteller he met while stationed in indonesia who gained new inspiration when he gained access to american comic books. the storytellers tale which begins with flute notes ascending and ends with flute notes descending offers a pleasing sense of unity but the other story about three soldiers who disappeared on an indonesian island in 1945 keeps interposing itself upon it. in the end however the two tales complete each other forming a deeply bizarre saga that the narrator his protestations notwithstanding weaves into a third tale the one we read. the tales elements will be familiar for lafferty fans a bloodthirsty but colorful pirate a willful young woman intent on withholding sexual favors a fell scheme foiled by a clever trick. neither will these readers be surprised by the rather idealized portrait of pirates nor with what andrew ferguson calls laffertys lurid depictions of death and dismemberment. what does startle us is that the trick turns on the incest taboo something lafferty never otherwise wrote about. the brutal but poetic willy jones finally wins over margaret daughter of a man he murdered and succeeds in consummating his love but when he disregards her warning not to resume pirating she exacts a grotesque vengeance upon his return to their sinister island which forever frustrates his desire to board his wife lest he unwittingly commit the abomination of incest. since her trick requires both margaret and her nubile indeed indistinguishable daughter born and bred during willys twenty year absence to be at once dead and alive the grotesque family romance seethes with the freudian unheimlich or uncanny and leads in time to father mother and daughter banding perversely together to attract other men to the island and then slaughter them as they frolicked with the two beautiful women. this tangle of rage and baffled lustthe impulse to incest deflected into murderous resolvegets its sequel in the tale told in the bar by an american soldier who alone escaped from willy jones island in 1945 and now after twenty years journeying home wishes for nothing but to go back again. a malay folk tale updated by wonder woman complete with numerous elements common to incest myths such as identical mother and daughter and a questing figure who was declared dead yet is still alive turns into the evocation of a composite belle dame sans merci who leaves the men she encounters wracked by sexual enthrallment and desolation. it is a strange short story even for lafferty and this is without mentioning the golems who are clearly something else or the uncanny intermediate condition that haunts the text such as the middle state between life and death which mother and daughter now inhabit or the middle land that the soldier traverses beneath the earth. and what does the title signify there are no cliffs in the story. the soldier now returning to his death remembers the two women as being like volcanoes and declares that we climbed them like mountains. man the uplift on them the shoulders were cliffs that laughed. the swaying its an odd image it does not sound like shoulders that he is praising and recalls a short story lafferty published a year later the cliff climbers in which the eponymous cliffwhich the narrator tells us at the outset is actually a spireclearly like the upthrust or rock chimney in continued on next rock also published in 1970 stands as a synecdoche too blatant for readers to overlook for a centurieslong male desire one that as in continued on next rock proves destructive to both pursuer and a pursued. laffertys use of cliff as an image of displaced sexuality remains finally mysterious as do his reasons for offering a different version of the three soldiers disappearance in his 1971 novel the devil is dead. there is only one story in the world the storyteller reminds us and the version proffered in cliffs that laughed gives us myth humor and virtuosity. for utter clarity you need look to another writer. cliffs that laughed between ten and tenthirty of the morning of october 1 1945 on an island that is sometimes called pulau petir and sometimes willy jones island neither of them its map name three american soldiers disappeared and have not been seen since. im going back there i tell you it was worth it. the limbs that laughed let them kill me ill get there oh here here ive got to get hold of myself. the three soldiers were sergeant charles santee of orange texas corporal robert casper of gobey tennessee and pfc timothy lorrigan of boston which is in one of the eastern states. i was one of those three soldiers. im going back there if it takes me another twenty years  no no no thats the wrong story. it happened on willy jones island also but its a different account entirely. thats the one the fellow told me in a bar years later just the other night after the usual didnt i used to know you in the islands one often makes these little mistakes and false starts galli said. it is a trick that is used in the trade. one exasperates people and pretends to be embarrassed. and then one hooks them. galli was an hereditary storyteller of the indies. there is only one story in the world he said and it pulls two ways. there is the reason part that says hell it cant be and there is the wonder part that says hell maybe it is. he was the storyteller and he offered to teach me the art. for we ourselves had a hook into galli. we had something he wanted. we used the same stories for a thousand years he said. now however a we have a new source the american comic books. my grandfather began to use these in another place and time and i use them now. i steal them from your orderly tents and i have a box full of them. i have space comics and commander midnight i have galactic gob and mighty mouse and the green hornet and the masked jetter. my grandfather also had copies of some of these but drawn by older hands. but i do not have wonder woman not a single copy. i would trade threeforone for copies of her. i would pay a premium. i can link her in with an island legend to create a whole new cycle of stories and i need new stuff all the time. have you a wonder woman when galli said this i knew that i had him. i didnt have a wonder woman but i knew where i could steal one. i believe though i am no longer sure that it was wonder woman meets the space magicians. i stole it for him. and in gratitude galli not only taught me the storytellers art but he also told me the following story imagine about flute notes ascending said galli. i havent my flute with me but a story should begin so to set the mood. imagine about ships coming out of the arabian ocean and finally to jilolo island and still more finally to the very island on which we now stand. imagine about waves and trees that were the greatgreatgrandfathers of the waves and trees we now have. it was about the year 1620 galli is telling it in the late afternoon of the high piracy. these moluccas had already been the rich spice islands for three hundred years. moreover they were on the road of the manila galleons coming from mexico and the isthmus. arabian hindu and chinese piracy had decayed shamefully. the english were crude at the business. in trade the dutch had become dominant in the islands and the portuguese had faded. there was no limit to the opportunities for a courageous and dedicated raider in the indies. they came. and not the least of these new raiding men was willy jones. it was said that willy jones was a welshman. you can believe it or not as a you like. the same thing has been said about the devil. willy was twenty five years old when he finally possessed his own ship with a mixed crew. the ship was built like a humpbacked bird with a lateen sail and suddenly appearing rows of winglike oars. on its prow was a swooping bird that had been carved in muskat. it was named the flying serpent or the feathered snake depending on what language you use. pause a moment said galli. set the mood. imagine about dead men variously. we come to the bloody stuff at once.  one early morning the feathered snake overtook a tall dutchman. the ships were grappled together and the men from the snake boarded the dutch ship. the men on the dutchman were armed but they had never seen such suddenness and savagery as shown by the dark men from the snake. there was slippery blood on the decks and the croaking of men being killed. i forgot to tell you that this was in the passage between the molucca sea and the banda galli said. the snake took a rich small cargo from the dutch ship a few ablebodied malay seamen some gold specie some papers of record and a dark dutch girl named margaret. these latter things willy jones preempted for himself then the snake devoured that tall dutchman and left only a few of its burning bones floating in the ocean. i forgot to tell you that the tall dutch ship was named the luchtkastell galli said. willy jones watched the luchtkastell disappearing under the water. he examined the papers of record and the dark dutch girl margaret. he made a sudden decision he would cash his winnings and lay up for a season. he had learned about an island in the papers of record. it was a rich island belonging to the richest of the dutch spice men who had gone to the bottom with the luchtkastell. the fighting crew would help willy jones secure the island for himself and in exchange he would give them his ship and the whole raiding territory and the routes he had worked out. willy jones captured the island and ruled it. from the ship he kept only the gold the dark dutch girl margaret and three golems which had once been ransom from a jew in oman. i forgot to tell you that margaret was the daughter of the dutch spice man who had owned the island and the tall ship and who was killed by willy galli said and the island really belonged to margaret now as the daughter of her father. for one year willy jones ruled the small settlement drove the three golems and the men who already lived there had the spices gathered and baled and stored they were worth their weight in silver and built the big house. and for one year he courted the dark dutch girl margaret having been unable to board her as he had all other girls. she refused him because he had killed her father because he had destroyed the luchtkastell which was family and nation to her and because he had stolen her island. this margaret though she was pretty and trim as a kuching had during the affair of the feathered snake and the luchtkastell twirled three seamen in the air like pinwheels at one time and thrown them all into the ocean. she had eyes that twinkled like the compounded eyes of the devilfly they could glint laughter and fury at the same time. those girls were like volcanoes the man said. slim strong mountains and we climbed them like mountains. man the uplift on them the shoulders were cliffs that laughed. the swaying no no belay that last paragraph thats from the ramble of the fellow in the bar and it keeps intruding. i forgot to tell you that she reminds me of wonder woman galli said. willy jones believed that margaret was worth winning unbroken as he  was not at all sure that he could break her. he courted her as well as he could and he used to advantage the background of the goldengreen spicery on which they lived. imagine about the permata bird that nests on the moon galli said and which is the most passionate as well as the noblestsinging of the birds. imagine about flute notes soaring. willy jones made this tune to margaret the nutmeg moon is the third moon of the year. the tides come in like loose silk all its nights. the ground is animated by the bare feet of margaret who is like the pelepah of the koeng flower. willy made this tune in the malaya language in which all the words end in ang. imagine about water leaping down rocky hills galli said. imagine about red birds romping in green groves. willy jones made another tune to margaret a woman with shoulders so strong that a man might ride upon them the while she is still the little girl watching for the black ship of the hero who is the same age as the sky but she does not realize that i am already here. willy made this tune in the dutch language in which all the words end in lijk. imagine about another flute joining the first one and their notes scamper like birds galli said. willy jones made a last tune to margaret  damnation that is enough of moonlight and tomorrows now there are mats to plait and kain to sew. even the smallest crab knows to build herself a house in the sand. margaret should be raking the oven coals and baking a roti. i wonder why she is so slow in seeing this. willy made this tune in the welsh language in which all the words end in gwbl. when the one year was finished they were mated. there was still the chilliness there as though she would never forgive him for killing her father and stealing her island but they began to be in accord. here pause five minutes to indicate an idyllic interlude galli said. we sing the song bagang kali berjumpa if you know the tune. we flute if i have my flute. the idyllic interlude passed. then willys old ship the feathered snake came back to the island. she was in a pitiful state of misuse. she reeked of old and new blood and there were none left on her but nine sick men. these nine men begged willy jones to become their captain again to set everything right. willy washed the nine living skeletons and fed them up for three days. they were fat and able by then. and the three golems had refitted the ship. all she needs is a strong hand at the helm again said willy jones. i will sail her again for a week and a day. i will impress a new crew and once more make her the terror of the spice islands. then i will return to my island knowing that i have done a good deed in restoring the snake to the bloody work for which she was born. if you go willy jones you will be gone for many years said the dark dutch margaret. only one at the most said willy. and i will be in my grave when you return. there is no grave could hold you margaret. aye it may not hold me. ill out of it and confront you when you come back. but it gives one a weirdness to be in the grave for only a few years. i will not own you for my husband when you do come back. you will not even know whether i am the same woman that you left and you will never know. i am a volcano but i banked my hatred and accepted you. but if you leave me now i will erupt against you forever. but willy jones went away in the flying serpent and left her there. he took two of the golems with him and he left one of them to serve margaret.  what with one thing and another he was gone for twenty years. we were off that morning to satisfy our curiosity about the big house the fellow said since we would soon be leaving the island forever. you know about the big house. you were on willy jones island too. the jilolos call it the house of skulls and the malaya and indonesia people will not speak about it at all. we approached the big house that was not more than a mile beyond our perimeter. it was a large decayed building but we had the sudden feeling that it was still inhabited. and it wasnt supposed to be. then we saw the two of them the mother and the daughter. we shook like we were unhinged and we ran to them. they were so alike that we couldnt tell them apart. their eyes twinkled like the compounded eyes of a creature that eats her mate. noonday lightning how it struck arms that swept you off your feet and set your bones to singing we knew that they were not twins or even sisters. we knew that they were mother and daughter. i have never encountered anything like them in my life. whatever happened to the other two soldiers i know it was worth it to them. whatever happened to them i dont care if they kill me they were perfect those two women even though we werent with them for five minutes. then it was the badger.    no no no thats the wrong story again. thats not the story galli told me. thats part of the story the fellow told me in the bar. his confused account keeps interposing itself possibly because i knew him slightly when we were both soldiers on willy jones island. but he had turned queer that fellow. it is the earthquake belt around the world that is the same as the legend belt he said and the middleworld underlies it all. thats why i was able to walk it. it was as though he had been keelhauled around the world. i hadnt known him well. i didnt know which of the three soldiers he was. i had heard that they were all dead. imagine about conspiracy stuff now said galli. imagine about a whispering in a pinang grove before the sun is up. how can i spook that man margaret asked her golem shortly after she had been abandoned by willy jones. but i am afraid that a mechanical man would not be able to tell me how. i will tell you a secret said the golem. we are not mechanical men. certain wise and secret men believe that they made us but they are wrong. they have made houses for us to live in no more. there are many of us unhoused spirits and we take shelter in such bodies as we find. that being so i know something of the houseless spirits in the depth of every man. i will select one of them and we will spook willy jones with that one. willy is a welshman who has become by adoption a dutchman and a malayan and a jilolo man. there is one old spook running through them all. i will call it up when it is time. i forgot to tell you that the name of margarets golem was meshuarat galli said.  after twenty years of high piracy willy jones returned to his island. and there was the dark dutch margaret standing as young and as smoldering as when he had left. he leaped to embrace her and found himself stretched flat on the sand by a thunderous blow. he was not surprised and was not as he had at first believed decapitated. almost he was not displeased. margaret had often been violent in her lovemaking. but i will have you willy swore as he tasted his own blood delightfully in his mouth and pulled himself up onto hands and knees. i have ridden the margarettiger before. you will never ride my loins you lecherous old goat she rang at him like a bell. i am not your wife. i am the daughter that you left here in the womb. my mother is in the grave on the hill. willy jones sorrowed terribly and he went to the grave. but margaret came up behind him and drove in the cruel lance. i told you that when you came back you would not know whether i was the same woman you had left she chortled and you will never know margaret you are my wife willy jones gasped.  am i of an age to be your wife she jibed. regard me of what age do i seem to be of the same age as when i left said willy. but perhaps you have eaten of the besok nut and so do not change your appearance. i forgot to tell you about the besok nut said galli. if one eats the nut of the besok tree the tomorrow tree the time tree that one will not age. but this is always accompanied by a chilling unhappiness. perhaps i did eat it said margaret. but that is my grave there and i have lain in it many years as has she. you are prohibited from touching either of us. are you the mother or the daughter witch you will never know. you will see us both for we take turns and you will not be able to tell us apart. see the grave is always disturbed and the entrance is easy. ill have the truth from the golem who served you while i was gone willy swore.   ور a golem is an artificial man said galli. they were made by the jews and arabs in earlier ages but now they say that they have forgotten how to make them. i wonder that you do not make them yourselves for you have advanced techniques. you tell them and you picture them in your own heroic literature he patted the comic books under his arm but you do not have them in actuality. the golem told willy jones that the affair was thus a daughter had indeed been born to margaret. she had slain the child and had then put it into the middle state. thereafter the child stayed sometimes in the grave and sometimes she walked about the island. and she grew as any other child would. and margaret herself had eaten the besok nut so that she would not age. when mother and daughter had come to the same age and appearance and it had only been the very day before that the day before willy jones had returned then the daughter had also eaten the besok nut. now the mother and daughter would be of the same appearance forever and not even a golem could tell them apart. willy jones came furiously onto the woman again. i was sure before and now i am even more sure that you are margaret he said and now i will have you in my fury. we both be margaret she said. but i am not the same one you apprehended earlier. we changed places while you talked to the golem. and we are both in the middle state and we have both been dead in the grave and you dare not touch either of us ever. a welshman turned dutchman turned malayan turned jilolo has this spook in him four times over. the devil himself will not touch his own daughters. the last part was a lie but willy jones did not know it. we be in confrontation forever then said willy jones. i will make my big house a house of hate and a house of skulls. you cannot escape from its environs neither can any visitor. ill kill them all and pile their skulls up high for a monument to you. then willy jones ate a piece of bitter bark from the pokok ru. i forgot to tell you that when a person eats bark from the pokok ru in anger his anger will sustain itself forever galli said. if its visitors you want for the killing i and my motherdaughter will provide them in numbers said margaret. men will be attracted here forever with no heed for danger. i will eat a telor tuntong of the special sort and all men will be attracted here even to their death. i forgot to tell you that if a female eats the telor tuntong of the special sort all males will be attracted irresistibly galli said. ah you smile as though you doubted that the besok nut or the bark of the pokok ru or the telor tuntong of the special sort could have such effects. but yourselves come now to wonder drugs like little boys. in these islands they are all around you and you too blind to see. it is no ignorant man who tells you this. i have read the booklets from your orderly tents physics without mathematics cosmology without chaos psychology without brains. it is myself the master of all sciences and disciplines who tells you that these things do work. besides hard science there is soft science the science of shadow areas and story areas and you do wrong to deny it the name. i believe that you yourself can see what had to follow from the dispositions of the margarets and willy jones galli said. for hundreds of years men from everywhere came to the margarets who could not be resisted. and willy jones killed them all and piled up their skulls. it became in a very savage form what you call the badger game. galli was a goodnatured and unhandsome brown man. he worked around the army base as translator knowing besides his native jilolo the malayan dutch japanese and english languages and as every storyteller must the arabian. his english was whatever he wanted it to be and he burlesqued the speech of the american soldiers to the australians and the australians to the americans.  man it was a badger the man said. it was a grizzlehaired glareeyed flatheaded underslung pigeontoed hookclawed clamjawed badger from badger game corner they moved in on us but id take my chances and go back and do it again. we hadnt frolicked with the girls for five minutes when the things moved in on us. i say things i dont know whether they were men or not. if they were they were the coldest three men i ever saw. but they were directed by a man who made up for it. he was livid hopping with hatred. they moved in on us and began to kill us.  no no that isnt part of gallis story. thats some more of the ramble that the fellow told me in the bar the other evening. it has been three hundred years and the confrontation continues. there are skulls of malayan men and jilolo men piled up there and of dutchmen and englishmen and of portuguese men of chinamen and filipinos and goanese of japanese and of the men from the united states and australia. only this morning there were added the skulls of two united states men and there should have been three of them galli said. they came as have all others because the margarets ate the telor tuntong of the special sort. it is a fact that with a species whether insect or shelled thing or other where the male gives his life in the mating the female has always eaten of this telor tuntong. youd never talk the males into such a thing with words alone. how is it that there were only two united states skulls this morning and there should have been three i asked him. one of them escaped galli explained and that was unusual. he fell through a hole to the middle land that third one of them. but the way back from the middle land to ones own country is long and it must be walked. it takes at least twenty years wherever ones own country is and the joker thing about it is that the man is always wanting to go the other way. that is the end of the story but let it not end abruptly galli said. sing the song chari yang besar if you remember the tune. imagine about flute notes lingering in the air.   i was lost for more than twenty years and thats a fact the man said. he gripped the bar with the most knotted hands i ever saw and laughed with a merriment so deep that it seemed to be his bones laughing. did you know that theres another world just under this world or just around the corner from it i walked all day every day. i was in a torture for i suspected that i i was going the wrong way and i could go no other. and i sometimes suspected that the middle land through which i traveled was in my head a derangement from the terrible blow that one of the things gave me as he came in to kill me. and yet there are correlates that convince me it was a real place. i wasnt trying to get home. i was trying to get back to those girls even if it killed me. there werent any colors in that world all gray tones but otherwise it wasnt much different from this one. there were even bars there a little like the red rooster. i forgot to tell you that it was in the red rooster bar that the soldier from the islands told me the parts of his story. ive got to get back there. i think i know the way now and how to get on the road. i have to travel it through the middle land you know. theyll kill me of course and i wont even get to jazz those girls for five minutes but ive got to get back there. going to take me another twenty years though. that sure is a weary walk.   i never knew him well and i dont remember which of the names was his. but a man from orange texas or from gobey tennessee or from boston in one of the eastern states is on a twentyyear walk through the middle land to find the dark dutch margarets and death. i looked up a couple of things yesterday. there was revels recent work on moluccan narcotics. he tells of the besok nut which does seem to inhibit aging but which induces internal distraction and hypersexuality. there is the pokok ru whose bitter bark impels even the most gentle to violent anger. there is one sort of telor tuntong which sets up an inexplicable aura about a woman eater and draws all males overpoweringly to her. there is much research still to be done on these narcotics revel writes. i dipped into mandragos earthquake and legend and the middle world. he states that the earthquake belt around the world is also the legend belt and that one of the underlying legends is of the underlying land the middle world below this world where one can wander lost forever. and i went down to the red rooster again the next evening which was last evening to ask about the man and to see if he could give me a more cogent account. for i had reremembered gallis old story in the meanwhile. no he was just passing through town the barman said. had a long trip ahead of him. he was sort of a nutty fellow. ive often said the same thing about you. that is the end of the other story but let it not end suddenly. pause for a moment to savor it. sing the song itu masa dahulu if you remember the tune. imagine about flute notes falling. i dont have a flute but a story should end so. sevenday terror introduction by connie willis sevenday terror was not my first introduction to r. a. laffertythat was slow tuesday nightbut it instantly became my favorite lafferty story and remains so to this day in spite of intense competition from the hole on the corner the aforementioned slow tuesday night and thus we frustrate charlemagne. sevenday terror is part of the proud tradition of science fiction stories like c. l. moore and henry kuttners mimsy were the borogoves and ray bradburys zero hour which are about children and how they see the world entirely differently from adults a way of seeing that grants them incomprehensible and sometimes dangerous powers. but laffertys children stand alone in their audacity precociousness and ruthless common sense. and wisdom clarissas absolutely right about the dangers of letting scientific discoveries like the disappearer fall into irresponsible hands i.e. those of adults. and even though this story is as lighthearted as lafferty comes his wry awareness of how the world works is still present. officer comstock for instance has a knack for getting near the heart of dark matters. this is why he was walking a beat out in the boondocks instead of sitting in a chair downtown. but mostly laffertys just having fun here and so are we. the willoughby kids from clarence down to threeyearold cyril are charmingly incorrigible the dialogues hilarious and we get to meet the esteemed scientist willy mcgilly and his pals who pop up in several lafferty stories. plus there are oatmeal boxes gold watches floods fireplugs cats local officials beer cans and an ending you should have seen coming but didnt. in other words lafferty at his best. so sit back and prepare to have a really good time. sevenday terror is there anything you want to make disappear clarence willoughby asked his mother. a sink full of dishes is all i can think of. how will you do it i just built a disappearer. all you do is cut the other end out of a beer can. then you take two pieces of red cardboard with peepholes in the middle and fit them in the ends. you look through the peepholes and blink. whatever you look at will disappear. oh. but i dont know if i can make them come back. wed better try it on something else. dishes cost money. as always myra willoughby had to admire the wisdom of her nineyear old son. she would not have had such foresight herself. he always did. you can try it on blanche mannerss cat outside there. nobody will care if it disappears except blanche manners. all right. he put the disappearer to his eye and blinked. the cat disappeared from the sidewalk outside. his mother was interested. i wonder how it works. do you know how it works yes. you take a beer can with both ends cut out and put in two pieces of cardboard. then you blink. . never mind. take it outside and play with it. you hadnt better make anything disappear in here till i think about this. but when he had gone his mother was oddly disturbed.  i wonder if i have a precocious child. why theres lots of grown people who wouldnt know how to make a disappearer that would work. i wonder if blanche manners will miss her cat very much clarence went down to the plugged nickel a pot house on the corner. do you have anything you want to make disappear nokomis only my paunch. if i make it disappear itll leave a hole in you and youll bleed to death. thats right i would. why dont you try it on the fireplug outside this in a way was one of the happiest afternoons ever in the neighborhood. the children came from blocks around to play in the flooded streets and gutters and if some of them drowned and we dont say that they did drown in the flood and brother it was a flood why you have to expect things like that. the fire engines whoever heard of calling fire engines to put out a flood were apparatusdeep in water. the policemen and ambulance men wandered around wet and bewildered. resuscitator resuscitator anybody wanna resuscitator chanted clarissa willoughby. oh shut up said the ambulance attendants. nokomis the bar man in the plugged nickel called clarence inside. i dont believe just for the moment id tell anyone what happened to that fireplug. i wont tell if you wont tell said clarence. officer comstock was suspicious. theres only seven possible explanations one of the seven willoughby kids did it. i dunno how. itd take a bulldozer to do it and then thered be something left of the plug. but however they did it one of them did it. officer comstock had a talent for getting near the truth of dark matters. this is why he was walking a beat out here in the boondocks instead of sitting in a chair downtown. a clarissa said officer comstock in a voice like thunder. resuscitator resuscitator anybody wanna resuscitator chanted  clarissa. do you know what happened to that fireplug asked officer c. i have an uncanny suspicion. as yet it is no more than that. when i am better informed i will advise you. clarissa was eight years old and much given to uncanny suspicions. » clementine harold corinne jimmy cyril he asked the five younger willoughby children. do you know what happened to that fireplug there was a man around yesterday. i bet he took it said clementine. i dont even remember a fireplug there. i think youre making a fuss about nothing said harold. city halls going to hear about this said corinne. pretty dommed sure said jimmy but i wont tell. cyril cried officer comstock in a terrible voice. not a terrifying voice a terrible voice. he felt terrible now. great green bananas said cyril im only three years old. i dont see how its even my responsibility. clarence said officer comstock. clarence gulped. do you know where the fireplug went clarence brightened. no sir. i dont know where it went. a bunch of smart alecs from the water department came out and shut off the water for a few blocks around and put some kind of cap on in place of the fireplug. this sure is going to be a funnysounding report said one of them. officer comstock walked away discouraged. dont bother me miss manners he said. i dont know where to look for your cat. i dont even know where to look for a fireplug. a i have an idea said clarissa that when you find the cat you will find the fireplug in the same place. as yet its only an idea. ozzie murphy wore a little hat on top of his head. clarence pointed his weapon and winked. the hat was no longer there but a little trickle of blood was running down the pate. i dont believe id play with that any more said nokomis. whos playing said clarence. this is for real. this was the beginning of the sevenday terror in the heretofore obscure neighborhood. trees disappeared from the parks lamp posts were as though they had never been wally waldorf drove home got out slammed the door of his car and there was no car. as george mullendorf came up the walk to his house his dog pete ran to meet him and took a flying leap to his arms. the dog left the sidewalk but something happened the dog was gone and only a bark lingered for a moment in the puzzled air. a but the worst were the fireplugs. the second plug was installed the morning after the disappearance of the first. in eight minutes it was gone and the flood waters returned. another one was in by twelve oclock. within three minutes it had vanished. the next morning fireplug number four was installed. the water commissioner was there the city engineer was there the chief of police was there with a riot squad the president of the parent teachers association was there the president of the university was there the mayor was there three gentlemen of the fbi a newsreel photographer eminent scientists and a crowd of honest citizens. lets see it disappear now said the city engineer. lets see it disappear now said the police chief. lets see it disait did didnt it said one of the eminent scientists. and it was gone and everybody was very wet. at least i have the picture sequence of the year said the photographer. but his camera and apparatus disappeared from the midst of them. shut off the water and cap it said the commissioner. and dont put in another plug yet. that was the last plug in the warehouse. this is too big for me said the mayor. i wonder that tass doesnt have it yet. tass has it said a little round man. i am tass. if all of you gentlemen will come into the plugged nickel said nokomis and try one of our new fire hydrant highballs you will all be happier. these are made of good corn whiskey brown sugar and hydrant water from this very gutter. you can be the first to drink them. business was phenomenal at the plugged nickel for it was in front of its very doors that the fireplugs disappeared in floods of gushing water. i know a way we can get rich said clarissa several days later to her father tom willoughby. everybody says theyre going to sell their houses for nothing and move out of the neighborhood. go get a lot of money and buy them all. then you can sell them again and get rich. i wouldnt buy them for a dollar each. three of them have disappeared already and all the families but us have their furniture moved out in their front yards. there might be nothing but vacant lots in the morning. good then buy the vacant lots. and you can be ready when the houses come back.  come back are the houses going to come back do you know anything about this young lady i have a suspicion verging on a certainty. as of now i can say no more.   three eminent scientists were gathered in an untidy suite that looked as though it belonged to a drunken sultan. this transcends the metaphysical. it impinges on the quantum continuum. in some way it obsoletes boff said dr. velikof vonk. the contingence of the intransigence is the most mystifying aspect said arpad arkabaranan. yes said willy mcgilly. who would have thought that you could do it with a beer can and two pieces of cardboard when i was a boy i used an oatmeal box and red crayola. i do not always follow you said dr. vonk. i wish you would speak plainer. so far no human had been injured or disappearedexcept for a little blood a on the pate of ozzie murphy on the lobes of conchita when her gaudy earrings disappeared from her very ears a clipped finger or so when a house vanished as the front doorknob was touched a lost toe when a neighborhood boy kicked a can and the can was not probably not more than a pint of blood and three or four ounces of flesh all together. now however mr. buckle the grocery man disappeared before witnesses. this was serious. some meanlooking investigators from downtown came out to the willoughbys. the meanestlooking one was the mayor. in happier days he had not been a mean man but the terror had now reigned for seven days. there have been ugly rumors said one of the mean investigators that link certain events to this household. do any of you know anything about them i started most of them said clarissa. but i didnt consider them ugly. cryptic rather. but if you want to get to the bottom of this just ask me a question.  did you make those things disappear asked the investigator. that isnt the question said clarissa. do you know where they have gone asked the investigator. that isnt the question either said clarissa. can you make them come back why of course i can. anybody can. cant you i cannot. if you can please do so at once. i need some stuff. get me a gold watch and a hammer. then go down to the drug store and get me this list of chemicals. and i need a yard of black velvet and a pound of rock candy. shall we asked one of the investigators. yes said the mayor. its our only hope. get her anything she wants. and it was all assembled. why does she get all the attention asked clarence. i was the one who made all the things disappear. how does she know how to get them back i knew it cried clarissa with hate. i knew he was the one that did it. he read in my diary how to make a disappearer. if i was his mother id whip him for reading his little sisters diary. thats what happens when things like that fall into irresponsible hands. she poised the hammer over the mayors gold watch now on the floor. i have to wait a few seconds. this cant be hurried. itll only be a little while. the second hand swept around to the point that was preordained for it before the world began. clarissa suddenly brought down the hammer with all her force on the beautiful gold watch. thats all she said. your troubles are over. see there is blanche mannerss cat on the sidewalk just where she was seven days ago. and the cat was back. now lets go down to the plugged nickel and watch the fireplugs come back. they had only a few minutes to wait. it came from nowhere and clanged into the street like a sign and a witness. now i predict said clarissa that every single object will return exactly seven days from the time of its disappearance. the sevenday terror had ended. the objects began to reappear. how asked the mayor did you know they would come back in seven days because it was a sevenday disappearer that clarence made. i also know how to make a nineday a thirteenday a twentysevenday and an eleven year disappearer. i was going to make a thirteenyear one but for that you have to color the ends with the blood from a little boys heart and cyril cried every time i tried to make a good cut. you really know how to make all of these yes. but i shudder if the knowledge should ever come into unauthorized hands. i shudder too clarissa. but tell me why did you want the chemicals for my chemistry set. and the black velvet for doll dresses. and the pound of rock candy how did you ever get to be mayor of this town if you have to ask questions like that what do you think i wanted the rock candy for one last question said the mayor. why did you smash my gold watch with the hammer oh said clarissa that was for dramatic effect. in boomer flats which originally appeared in if magazine in 1971 lafferty expands on the internal mythology of his work and returns to familiar themes. evolution and how humans fit into it through spontaneous evolutionary leaps features in other stories such as ginny wrapped in the sun and in deepest glass. lafferty asserted that storytelling was a manifestation of ancestry and that storytellers belonged to the old redbone people. the journey to boomer flats brings the reader to a strange town where those people walk daily. to those who know who ivan sanderson is the clue is there from the very first line eminent scientists arpad arkabaranan willy mcgilly and dr. velikof vonk declaring themselves his spiritual offspring are in search of fortean phenomena specifically the absm abominable snowman. its a literal wildgoose chase as mcgilly notes referring to the hundreds of mud geese in flight across the sky. this sort of linguistic play the metaphorical made real ripples through the story and even sometimes slides it over into poetrys realm such as the repeated reassurance crayola catfish gives the eminent scientists about their drinks theyre fixing them for you now. ill bring them after a while. boomer flats is a shadow town an echo of the town of boomer. something a little queer and primordial about the whole place lafferty warns the reader who already knows were wandering in strange territory. the three eminent scientists know it too. dr. velikof vonks eyes grin out of deep folk memory as he begins to drink what crayola has brought him a clay cup that smelled strongly of river perhaps of interstadial river. introduction by cat rambo boomer flats the drinks the green snake snorters move the trio into a strange mythopoetic world in washes like a television shows set where each cut away and back reveals odder and odder details changed and added. the prose becomes stranger and stranger at the same time moving into deeper and deeper waters of wordplay. that shabby man playing dominoes is a bear. pieces are falling off a man called the comet. and then the giants enter standing around the edges of the room in their black hats. this is where the legends dwell almost as though boomer flats is the secret heart of laffertys cosmos. the three eminent scientists are specifically identified as three magi but what they find is not an answer in the form of the christ child but more and more questions about the world itself. instead the ending turns back to storys heart in a way that pulls the reader further in and farther out so to speak. this is lafferty at his luminiferous best slipstream before the term was ever invented. in the tracks of our spiritual father ivan sanderson we may now have trailed a clutch of absms to their lair the eminent scientist arpad arkabaranan was saying in his rattling voice. and that lair may not be a mountain thicket or rain forest or swamp but these scrimpy red clay flats. i would almost give my life for the success of this quest but it seems that it should have a more magnificent setting. it looks like a wildgoose chase the eminent scientist willy mcgilly commented. but no willy was not downgrading their quest. he was referring to the wild geese that rose about them from the edges of the flats with clatter and whistle and honk. this was a flightway a chase of theirs. there were hundreds of them if one had the fine eyes to pick them out from the background. mud geese willy said. we dont see as many of them as when i was a boy. i do not and i am afraid that i will not believe in the absms said the eminent scientist dr. velikof vonk stroking hisno he didnt he didnt have onestroking his jaw and yet this is the thing that i also have most desired to find this missing link finally and to refute all believers in the other thing. we cant see the chain for the links said willy mcgilly. i never believed that any of them was missing. theres always been too many of them for the length of the chain thats the trouble. ive traveled a million miles in search of them said arpad. ive pretty well probed all the meager ribs of the world in that travel. my fear has always been that id miss them by a trick even that in some unaccountable way i boomer flats wouldnt know them when i found them. it would be ironic if we did find them in such a place as this not a wild place only a shabby and overlooked place. my own fear has been that when i finally gazed on one i would wake with a start and find that i had been looking in a mirror said velikof. there must be some symbolism here that i dont understand. what is your own anticipation of them willy oh coming back to people ive always liked. there used to be a bunch of them on the edge of my hometown willy mcgilly said. come to think of it there used to be a bunch of them on the edge of every hometown. now theyre more likely to be found right in the middle of every town. theyre the scrubs you know for the bottoming of the breed. what are you talking about willy arpad asked sharply. what they were all talking about was absms.   every town in the south part of that county has a shadow or secondary. there is meehan and meehan corners perkins and perkins corner boomer and boomer flats. the three eminent scientists were driving the three miles from boomer to boomer flats looking for the bones and hopefully even the living flesh of a legend. it was that of the missing link of the abominable snowman the absm. it wasnt snowy country there but the socalled snowmen have been reported in every sort of climate and countryside. the local legend recently uncovered by arpad was that there was a nonafrican nonindian people of color living in the neighborhood of boomer flats between the sandbush thickets and the river. it was said that they lived on the very red mud banks of the river and that they lived a little in the river itself. then dr. velikof vonk had come onto a tape in a bunch of anthropological tapes and the tape contained sequences like this what do they do when the river floods ah they close their noses and mouths and ears with mud and they lie down with big rocks on their breasts and stay there till the flood has passed. can they be taught some of the children go to school and they learn. but when they are older then they stay at home and they forget. what sort of language do they talk ah they dont seem to talk very much. they keep to themselves. sometimes when they talk it is just plain cimarron valley english. what do they eat they boil river water in mud clay pots. they put in wild onions and greenery. the pottage thickens then i dont know how. it gets lumps of meat or clay in it and they eat that too. they eat frogs and fish and owls and thicket filaments. but mostly they dont eat very much of anything. it is said that they arent all of the same appearance. it is even said that they are born ah shapeless and thatahcould you tell me anything about that yeah. theyre born without much shape. most of them never do get much shape. when they have any well actually their mothers lick them into shape give them their appearance. its an old folk tale that bears do that. maybe they learned it from the bears then young fellow. theres quite a bit of bear mixture in them but the bears themselves have nearly gone from the flats and thickets now. more than likely the bears learned it from them. sometimes the mothers lick the cubs into the shape of regular people for a joke. that is the legend you keep saying legend. i dont know anything about legend. i just tell you what you ask me. ill tell you a funny one though. one of the mothers who was getting ready to bear happened to get ahold of an old movie magazine that some fishers from boomer had left on the river edge. there was a picture in it of the prettiest girl that anyone ever saw and it was a picture of all of that girl. this mother was tickled by that picture. she bore a daughter then and she licked her into the shape and appearance of the girl in the movie magazine. and the girl grew up looking like that and she still looks like that pretty as a picture. i dont believe the girl appreciates the joke. she is the prettiest of all the people though. her name is crayola catfish. are you having me old fellow have those creatures any humor some of them tell old jokes. john salt tells old jokes. the licorice man tells really old jokes. and man does the comet ever tell old jokes are the creatures longlived longlived as we want to be. the elixir comes from these flats you know. some of us use it some of us dont. are you one of the creatures sure im one of them. i like to get out from it sometimes though. i follow the harvests.  this tape recorded by an anthropology student at state university who by the way has since busted out of anthropology and is now taking hotel and restaurant management had greatly excited the eminent scientist dr. velikof vonk when he had played it along with several hundred other tapes that had come in that week from the anthropology circuit. he scratched hisno he didnt he didnt have onehe scratched his jowl and he phoned up the eminent scientists arpad arkabaranan and willy mcgilly. ill go ill go of course ill go arpad had cried. ive traveled a million miles in search of it and should i refuse to go sixty this wont be it this cant be it but ill never give up. yes well go tomorrow. sure ill go willy mcgilly said. ive been there before i kind of like those folks on the flats. i dont know about the biggest catfish in the world but the biggest catfish stories in the world have been pulled out of the cimarron river right about at boomer flats. sure well go tomorrow. this may be it velikof had said. how can we miss it i can almost reach out and scratch it on the nose from here. youll find yourself scratching your own nose thats how youll miss it. but its there and its real. i believe willy that there is a sort of amnesia that has prevented us finding them or remembering them accurately. not that velikof. its just that theyre always too close to see. so the next day the three eminent scientists drove over from ttown to come to boomer flats. willy mcgilly knew where the place was but his pointing out of the way seemed improbable velikof was more inclined to trust the information of people in boomer. and there was a difficulty there. people kept saying this is boomer. there isnt exactly any place called boomer flats. boomer flats wasnt on any map. it was too small even to have a post office. and the boomer people were exasperating in not knowing about it or knowing the way to it. three miles from here and you dont know where it is velikof asked one of them angrily. i dont even know that it is the boomer man had said in his own near anger. i dont believe that there is such a place. finally however other men told the eminent scientists that there sort of was such a place sort of a place. sort of a road going to it too. they pointed out the same improbable way that willy mcgilly had pointed out. the three eminents took the road. the flats hadnt flooded lately. the road was sand but it could be negotiated. they came to the town to the sort of town in the ragged river flats. there was such a place. they went to the cimarron hotel which was like any hotel anywhere only older. they went into the dining room for it was noon. it had tables but it was more than a dining room. it was a common room. it even had intimations of old elegance in blued pier mirrors. there was a dingy bar there. there was a pool table there and a hairy man was playing rotation with the comet on it. the comet was a long graybearded man in fact comet means a star with a beard and small pieces were always falling off him. claycolored men with their hats on were playing dominos at several of the tables and there were half a dozen dogs in the room. something a little queer and primordial about those dogs something a little queer and primordial about the whole place but as if set to serve as distraction there was a remarkably pretty girl there and she might have been a waitress. she seemed to be waiting either listlessly or profoundly for something. dr velikof vonk twinkled his deep eyes in their orbital caves perhaps he cogitated his massive brain behind his massive orbital ridges and he arrived by sheer mentality at the next step. have you a menu young lady he asked. no she answered simply but it wasnt simple at all. her voice didnt go with her prettiness. it was much more intricate than her appearance even in that one syllable. it was powerful not really harsh deep and resonant as caverns full and timeless. the girl was bigboned beneath her prettiness a a with heavy brindled hair and complex eyes. we would like something to eat arpad arkabaranan ventured. what do you have theyre fixing it for you now the girl said. ill bring it after a while. there was a rich river smell about the whole place and the room was badly lit. her voice is an odd one arpad whispered in curious admiration. like rocks rolled around by water but it also has a touch of springtime in it springtime of a very peculiar duality. not just a springtime its an interstadial time willy mcgilly stated accurately. ive noticed that about them in other places. its old green season in their voices green season between the ice. the room was lit only by hanging lamps. they had a flicker to them. they were not electric. theres a lot of the gaslight era in this place arpad gave the opinion but the lights arent gas lights either. no theyre hanging oil lamps velikof said. an amusing fancy just went through my head that they might be old whaleoil lamps. girl what do you burn in the hanging lamps willy mcgilly asked her. catfish oil she said in the resonant voice that had a touch of the green interstadial time in it. and catfish oil burns with a claycolored flame. can you bring us drinks while we wait velikof of the massive head asked. theyre fixing them for you now the girl said. ill bring them after a while. meanwhile on the old pool table the comet was beating the hairy man at rotation. nobody could beat the comet at rotation. we came here looking for strange creatures arpad said in the direction of the girl. do you know anything about strange creatures or people or where they can be found you are the only strange people who have come here lately she told them. then she brought their drinks to them three great sloshing clay cups or bulbous stems that smelled strongly of river perhaps of interstadial river. she set them in front of the eminents with something like a twinkle in her eyes something like but much more. it was laughing lightning flashing from under the ridges of that pretty head. she was awaiting their reaction. velikof cocked a big deep eye at his drink. this itself was a feat. other men hadnt such eyes or such brows above them as had velikof vonk. they took a bit of cocking and it wasnt done lightly. and velikof grinned out of deep folk memory as he began to drink. velikof was always strong on the folk memory bit. arpad arkabaranan screamed rose backward toppled his chair and stood aghast while pointing a shaking finger at his splashing clay cup. arpad was disturbed. willy mcgilly drank deeply from his own stirring vessel. why its green snake snorter he cried in amazement and delight. oh drink of drinks thoure a pleasure beyond expectation they used to serve it to us back home but i never even hoped to find it here. what great thing have we done to deserve this he drank again of the wonderful splashing liquor while the spray of it filled the air. and velikof also drank with noisy pleasure. the girl righted arpads chair put arpad into it again with strong hands and addressed him powerfully to his cresting breaker. but arpad was scared of his lively drink. its alive its alive was all that he could jabber. arpad arkabaranan specialized in primitives and primitives by definition are prime stuff. but there wasnt now in his moment of weakness enough prime stuff in arpad himself to face so pleasant and primitive a drink as this. the liquid was sparkling with bright action was adequately alcoholic something like choc beer and there was a green snake in each cup. velikof in his notebook states that they were green worms of the species vermis ebrius viridis but that is only a quibble. they were snakelike worms and of the size of small snakes and we will call them snakes. do get with it arpad willy mcgilly cried. the trick is to drink it up before the snake drinks it. i tell you though that the snakes can discern when a man is afraid of them. theyll fang the face off a man whos afraid of them. ah i dont believe that i want the drink arpad declared with sickish grace. im not much of a drinking man. so arpads green snake drank up his green snake snorter noisily and greedily. then it expiredit breathed out its life and evaporated. that green snake was gone. where did he go arpad asked nervously. he was still uneasy about the business. back to the catfish the girl said. all the snakes are spirits of catfish just out for a little ramble. interesting velikof said and he noted in his pocket notebook that the vermis ebrius viridis is not a discrete species of worm or snake but is rather spirit of catfish. it is out of such careful notation that science is built up. is there anything noteworthy about boomer flats velikof asked the girl then. has it any unique claim to fame yes the girl said. this is the place that the comets come back to. ah but the moths have eaten the comets willy mcgilly quoted from the old epic. the girl brought them three big clay bowls heaped with fish eggs and these they were to eat with three clay spoons. willy mcgilly and dr. velikof vonk addressed themselves to the rich meal with pleasure but arpad arkabaranan refused. why its all mixed with mud and sand and trash he objected. certainly certainly wonderful wonderful willy mcgilly slushed out the happy words with a mouth full of delicious goop. i always thought that something went out of the world when they cleaned up the old shantytown dish of shad roe. in some places they cleaned it up not everywhere. i maintain that roe at its best must always have at least a slight tang of river sewage. but arpad broke his clay spoon in disgust. and he would not eat. arpad had traveled a million miles in search of it but he didnt know it when he found it he hadnt any of it inside him so he missed it. one of the domino players at a near table the three eminents had noticed this some time before but had not fully realized it was a bear. the bear was dressed as a shabby man he wore a big black hat on his head he played dominos well he was winning. how is it that the bear plays so well velikof asked. he doesnt play at all well willy mcgilly protested. i could beat him. i could beat any of them. he isnt really a bear the girl said. he is my cousin. our mothers who were sisters were clownish. his mother licked him into the shape of a bear for fun. but that is nothing to what my mother did to me. she licked me into pretty face and pretty figure for a joke and now i am stuck with it. i think it is too much of a joke. im not really like this but i guess i may as well laugh at me just as everybody else does. what is your name arpad asked her without real interest. crayola catfish. but arpad arkabaranan didnt hear or recognize the name though it had been on a tape that dr. velikof vonk had played for them the same tape that had really brought them to boomer flats. arpad had now closed his eyes and ears and heart to all of it. the hairy man and the comet were still shooting pool but pieces were still falling off the comet. hes diminishing hes breaking up velikof observed. he wont last another hundred years at that rate. then the eminents left board and room and the cimarron hotel to go looking for absms who were rumored to live in that area. absm is the code name for the abominable snowman for the hairy woodman for the wild man of borneo for the sasquatch for the booger man for the apeman for the bearman for the missing link for the nine foottall giant things for the living neanderthals. it is believed by some that all of these beings are the same. it is believed by most that these things are no thing at all no where not in any form. and it seemed as if the most were right for the three eminents could not find hide nor hair rough hide and copious hair were supposed to be marks by which the absms might be known of the queer folks anywhere along the red bank of the cimarron river. such creatures as they did encounter were very like the shabby and untalkative creatures they had already encountered in boomer flats. they werent an ugly people they were pleasantly mud homely. they were civil and most often they were silent. they dressed something as people had dressed seventyfive years before that timeas the poor working people had dressed then. maybe they were poor maybe not. they didnt seem to work very much. sometimes a man or a woman seemed to be doing a little bit of work very casually. it may be that the redmud river was full of fish. something was splashing and jumping there. big turtles waddled up out of the water caked with mud even around their eyes. the shores and flats were treacherous and sometimes an eminent would sink into the sandmud up to the hips. but the broadfooted people of the area didnt seem to sink in. there was plenty of greenery or brownery for it had been the dusty weeks along the shores. there were muskrats there were even beavers there were skunks and possums and badgers. there were wolf dens and coyote dens digged into the banks and they had their particular smells about them. there were dog dens. there were coon trees. there were even bear dens or caves. but no that was not a bear smell either. what smell was it what lives in these clay caves velikof asked a woman who was digging river clams there. the giants live in them she said. well they were tall enough to be giants caves. a ninefooter need hardly stoop to enter one. we have missed it arpad said. there is nothing at all to be found here. i will travel farther and i may find it in other places. oh i believe we are right in the middle of it velikof gave the opinion. it is all around us arpad everything you wanted willy mcgilly insisted. but arpad arkabaranan would have none of the muddy water none of the red sand or the red sand caves nothing of anything here. the interest had all gone out of him. the three of them went back to the cimarron hotel without apparently finding primitive creature or missing link at all. they entered the common room of the hotel again. dominos were set before them. they played draw listlessly. you are sure that there are no odd creatures around this place arpad again asked the girl crayola catfish. john salt is an odd creature and he comes from this place crayola told them. the licorice man is an odd creature i suppose. so is ape woodman he used to be a bigtime football player. all three of them had regularpeople blood in them i suppose thats what made them odd. they were almost as odd as you three creatures. and the comet playing pool there is an odd one. i dont know what kind of blood he has in him to make him odd. how long has he been around here velikof asked. he returns every eightyseven years. he stays here about three years and hes already been here two of them. then he goes off on another circuit. he goes out past the planets and among the stars. oh and how does he travel out there velikof asked with cocked tongue and eye. with horse and buggy of course. oh there comet willy mcgilly called. is it true that you travel out among the stars with horse and buggy aye that i do the long graybearded man named comet called back with a horse named peegosh and a buggy named harma. its a flopeared horse and a broken buggy but they take me there. touch clay said crayola catfish for the lightning. they touched clay. everything was of baked clay anyhow even the dominos. and there had been lightning fantastic lightning dashing itself through every crack and cranny of the flimsy hotel. it was a lightning brighter than all the catfishoil lamps in the world put together. and it continued. there was clattering sequence thunder and there was a roaring booming sound that came from a few miles west of the thunder. the giants came in and stood around the edges of the room. they were all very much alike like brothers. they were tall and somber shabby black bearded to the eyes and with black hats on their heads. unkempt. all were about nine feet tall. shall i sound like a simpleton if i ask if they are really giants velikof questioned. as your eyes tell you they are the giants crayola said. they stay here in the outoftheway places even more than the rest of us. sometimes regular people see them and do not understand that they are regular people too. for that there is scandal. it was the scent of such a scandal i believe that brought the three of you here. but they are not apes or bears or monsters. they are people too. they are of your own same kindred velikof asked. oh yes. they are the uncles the old bachelors. thats why they grow tall and silent. thats why they stand around the edges of the room. and that is why they dig themselves caves into the banks and bluffs instead of living in huts. the roofs of huts are too low for them. it would be possible to build taller huts willy mcgilly suggested. it would be possible for you yes crayola said. it would not be possible for them. they are set in their ways. they develop a stoop and a gait because they feel themselves so tall. they let their hair grow and overflow all over their faces and around their eyes and all over their bodies also. they are the steers of the species. having no children or furniture what can they do but grow tall and ungainly like that this happens also to the steers of cattle and bears and apes that they grow tall and gangling. they become bashful you see so sometimes it is mistakenly believed that they are fierce. the roaring and booming from west of the thunder was becoming louder and nearer. the river was coming dangerously alive. all of the people in the room knew that it was now dark outside and it was not yet time to be night. the comet gave his pool cue to one of the bashful giants and came and sat with the eminents. you are magi he asked. i am a magus yes willy mcgilly said. we are called eminent scientists nowadays. velikof here also remains a magus but arpad has lost it all this day. you are not the same three i first believed the old comet said. those three passed me several of my cycles back. they had had word of an event and they had come from a great distance as soon as they heard it. but it took them near two thousand years to make the trip and they were worried that myth had them as already arriving long ago. they were worried that false magi had anticipated them and set up a preventing myth. and i believe that is what did happen. and your own myths old fellow have they preceded you or have you really been here before willy mcgilly asked. i see that you have a twisty tongue that turns out some really winding myths. thank you for that is ever my intent. myths are not merely things that were made in times past myths are among the things that maintain the present in being. i wish most strongly that the present should be maintained i often live in it. tell us old man why boomer flats is a place that the comets come back to willy said. oh its just one of the post stations where we change horses when we make our orbits. a lot of the comets come to the flats booger donati encke 1914c and halley. but why to boomer flats on the little cimarron river willy inquired. things are often more than they seem. the cimarron isnt really so little a river as you would imagine. actually it is the river named ocean that runs around all the worlds. old comet old man with the pieces falling off of you dr. velikof vonk asked out of that big head of his can you tell us just who are the under people that we have tracked all around the world and have probably found here no more than seventy miles from our own illustrious ttown a phyz like you have on you and you have to ask the old comet twinkled at velikof a man who twinkled like that had indeed been among the stars he had their dust on him. youre one of them you know. ive suspected that for a long time velikof admitted. but who are they and who am i wise willy here said it correctly to you last night that they were the scrubs who bottom the breed. but do not demean the scrubs they are the foundation. they are human as all of us are human. they are a race that underlies the other several races of man. when the bones and blood of the more manifest races grow too thin then they sustain you with the mixture of their strong kingship the mixing always goes on but in special eras it is more widespread. they are the link that is never really missing the link between the clay and the blood. why are they and me if i were not wellkempt and eminent sometimes taken to be animals velikof asked. why do they always live in such outlandish places they dont always. sometimes they live in very inlandish places. even wise willy understands that. but it is their function to stand apart and grow in strength. look at the strong bone structure of that girl there it is their function to invent formslook at the form her mother invented for her. they have a depth of mind and they have it particularly in those ghostly areas where the other races lack it. and they share and mingle it in those sudden motley ages of great achievement and vigor. consider the great ages of athens of florence of los angeles. and afterward this people will withdraw again to gather new strength and bottom. and why are they centered here in a tumbledown hotel that is like a series of old daguerreotypes willy mcgilly asked. will you tell us that there is something cosmic about this little old hotel as there is about this little old river aye of course there is willy. this is the hotel named xenodocheion. this is the special center of these xenoi these strangers and of all strangers everywhere. it isnt small it is merely that you can see but a portion of it at one time. and then they center here to keep out of the way. sometimes they live in areas and neighborhoods that regularized humanity has abandoned a whether in innercity or boondock. sometimes they live in eras and decades that regularized humanity has abandoned for their profundity of mind in the more ghostly areas they have come to have a cavalier way with time. what is wrong with that if regular people are finished with those days and times why may not others use them the roaring and booming to the west of the thunder had become very loud and very near now and in the immediate outdoors there was heavy rain. it is the time the girl crayola catfish cried out in her powerful and intricate voice. the flash flood is upon us and it will smash everything. we will all go and lie down in the river. they all began to follow her out the boomer flats people and the giants among them the eminents everybody. will you also lie down in the river comet willy mcgilly asked. somehow i dont believe it of you. no i will not. that isnt my way. i will take my horse and buggy and ascend above it. ah but comet will it look like a horse and buggy to us a no it will look quite other if you do chance to see it. and what are you really comet velikof asked him as they left him. what species do you belong to to the human species of course velikof. i belong to still another race of it another race that mixes sometimes and then withdraws again to gather more strength and depth. some individuals of us withdraw for quite long times. there are a number of races of us in the wide cousinship you see and it is a necessity that we be strangers to each other for a good part of the time. are you a saucerian oh saucerian be damned velikof harma means chariot or it means buggy it does not mean saucer. we are the comets. and our own mingling with the commonalty of people has also had quite a bit to do with those sudden incandescent eras. say id like to talk with you fellows again some time. ill be by this way again in about eightyseven years. maybe so said dr. velikof vonk. maybe so said willy mcgilly.   the eminents followed the boomer flats people to the river. and the comet we suppose took his horse and buggy and ascended out of it. odd old fellow he was pieces falling off him hed hardly last another hundred years. the red and black river was in surging flood with a bloodcolored crest bearing down. and the flatsthey were just too flat. the flood would be a mile wide here in one minute and everywhere in that width it would be deep enough and swift enough to drown a man. it was near dark it was near the limit of roaring sound. but there was a pile of large rocks there in the deepening shallows plenty of rocks at least one big heavy rock for every person. the boomer flats people understood what the rocks were for and the giants among them understood. two of the eminents understood and one of them arpad apparently did not. arpad was carrying on in great fear about the dangers of death by drowning. quickly then to cram mud into the eyes and ears and noses and mouths. there is plenty of mud and all of it is good. spirits of catfish protect us now it will be only for a few hours for two or three days at the most. arpad alone panicked. he broke and ran when crayola catfish tried to put mud in his mouth and nose to save him. he ran and stumbled in the rising waters to his death. but all the others understood. they lay down in the red roaring river and one of the giants set a heavy rock on the breast of every person of them to hold them down. the last of the giants then rolled the biggest of the rocks onto his own breast. so all were safe on the bottom of the surging torrent safe in the old mud clay cradle. nobody can stand against a surging flood like that the only way is to lie down on the bottom and wait it out. and it was a refreshing a deepening a renewing experience. there are persons both inside and outside the orders who make religious retreats of three days every year for their renewal. this was very like such a retreat. when the flood had subsided this was three days later they all rose again rolling the big rocks off their breasts they cleared their eyes and ears and mouths of the preserving mud and they resumed their ways and days. for velikof vonk and for willy mcgilly it had been an enriching experience. they had found the link that was not really lost leaving the other ninetynine meanwhile. they had grown in cousinship and wisdom. they said they would return to the flats every year at mudduck season and turtle egg season. they went back to ttown enlarged and happy. there is however a gap in the magi set due to the foolish dying of arpad arkabaranan. it is not of scripture that a set of magi should consist of only three. there have been sets of seven and nine and eleven. it is almost of scripture though that a set should not consist of less than three. in the masulla apocalypse it seems to be said that a set must contain at the least a comet a commoner and a catfish. the meaning of this is pretty muddy and it may be a mistranslation. there is dr. velikof vonk with his huge head with his heavy orbital ridges with the protruding nearmuzzle on him that makes the chin unnecessary and impossible with the great backbrain and the great good humor. he is and you had already guessed it of him an absm a neo neanderthal an unmissing link one of that branch of the human race that lives closest to the clay and the catfish. there is willy mcgilly who belongs and he himself has come to the realization of this quite lately to that race of mankind called the comets. he is quite bright and he has his periods. he himself is a shortorbit comet but for all that he has been among the stars. pieces fall off of him he leaves a wake but hell last a while yet. one more is needed so that this set of magi may be formed again. the other two aspects being already covered the third member could well be a regularized person. it could be an older person of ability an eminent. it could be a younger person of ability a preeminent. this person may be you. put your hand to it if you have the surety about you if you are not afraid of green snakes in the cup theyll fang the face off you if youre afraid of them or of claymud or of comet dust or of the rollicking world between. so heres a quick story of mine relevant to this particular story. my wife became pregnant when i was twentynine years old and when she told me the news a i was ecstatic b i suddenly begun waking up at three in the morning every night with the thought dude youre totally gonna die one day ricocheting through my brain. you dont need to be a genius of psychology to figure this one out. with the advent of our child i was no longer the final generation on the family chain a new link would be forged and i would be inevitably pulled into eternitys maw. i would survive by passing along my genes not by living forever which up to age twentynine apparently was my unspoken assumption. i got over it. my kids pretty great and i dont mind shuffling off the mortal coil because i helped make her and also i wrote a few books people might still read after im gone. im doing ok. but that jolt of awareness i got at twentynine pops up again every now and then in a slightly different way. i dont mind so much that i will die. but im sad that i will no longer exist. i enjoy existing. existing is pretty neat. and while im pretty sure that when i no longer exist i wont mind i didnt mind not existing before i was born after all right now im put out about it. i mean i put a lot of effort into developing a sense of self here people. i dont get to take it with me thats some bullshit right there i tell you. introduction by john scalzi old foot forgot its selfish of me but i dont mind that little bit of selfishness. it wont help me in the end but until then it gets me along. as i said this story is relevant to old foot forgot which is a story that makes me both happy and sad. happy because clearly lafferty got where i was coming from. sad because well. oblivion awaits doesnt it fine. bring it on eventually. until then hey im here man. and i like it. dookhdoctor it is a sphairikos patient lay sister moira p. t. de c. cried happily. it is a genuine spherical alien patient. youve never had one before not in good faith. i believe it is what you need to distract you from theah happy news about yourself. it is good for a dookhdoctor to have a different patient sometimes. thank you lay sister. let it him her fourth case fifth case or whatever come in. no ive never had a sphairikos in good faith. i doubt if this one is but i will enjoy the encounter. the sphairikos rolled or pushed itself in. it was a big one either a blubbery kid or a fullgrown one. it rolled itself along by extruding and withdrawing pseudopods. and it came to rest grinning a large translucent rubbery ball of fleeting colors. hello dookhdoctor it said pleasantly. first i wish to extend my own sympathy and that of my friends who do not know how to speak to you for the happy news about yourself. and secondly i have an illness of which you may cure me. but the sphairikoi are never ill dookhdoctor drague said dutifully. how did he know that the round creature was grinning at him by the colors of course by the fleeting colors of it. they were grinning colors. my illness is not of the body but of the head said the sphairikos. but the sphairikoi have no heads my friend. then it is of another place and another name dookhdoctor. there is a thing in me suffering. i come to you as a dookhdoctor. i have an illness in my dookh. old foot forgot that is unlikely in a sphairikos. you are all perfectly balanced each a cosmos unto yourself. and you have a central solution that solves everything. what is your name krug sixteen which is to say that i am the sixteenth son of krug the sixteen fifth case son of course. dookhdoc the pain is not in me entirely it is in an old forgotten part of me. but you sphairikoi have no parts krug sixteen. you are total and indiscriminate entities. how would you have parts it is one of my pseudopods extended and then withdrawn in much less than a second long ago when i was a little boy. it protests it cries it wants to come back. it has always bothered me but now it bothers me intolerably. it screams and moans constantly now. do not the same ones ever come back no. never. never exactly the same ones. will exactly the same water ever run past one point in a brook no. we push them out and we draw them back. and we push them out again millions of times. but the same one can never come back. there is no identity. but this one cries to come back and now it becomes more urgent. dookhdoc how can it be there is not one same molecule in it as when i was a boy. there is nothing of that pseudopod that is left but parts of it have come out as parts of other pseudopods and now there can be no parts left. there is nothing remaining of that foot it has all been absorbed a million times. but it cries out and i have compassion on it. krug sixteen it may possibly be a physical or mechanical difficulty a pseudopod imperfectly withdrawn a sort of rupture whose effects you interpret wrongly. in that case it would be better if you went to your own doctors or doctor i understand that there is one. that old fogey cannot help me dookhdoc. and our pseudopods are always perfectly withdrawn. we are covered with the twinkling salve it is onethird of our bulk. and if we need more of it we can make more of it ourselves or we can beg some of it from a class four who makes it prodigiously. it is the solvent for everything. it eases every possible wound it makes us round as balls you should use it yourself dookhdoc. but there is one small foot in me dissolved long ago that protests and protests. oh the shrieking the horrible dreams but the sphairikoi do not sleep and do not dream. right enough dookhdoc. but theres an old dead foot of mine that sure does dream loud and wooly. the sphairikos was not grinning now. he rolled about softly in apprehension. how did the dookhdoctor know that it was apprehension by the fleeting colors. they were apprehension colors now. krug sixteen i will have to study your case said the dookhdoctor. i will see if there are any references to it in the literature though i dont believe that there are. i will seek for analogy. i will probe every possibility. can you come back at the same hour tomorrow i will come back dookhdoc krug sixteen sighed. i hate to feel that small vanished thing crying and trembling. it rolled or pushed itself out of the clinic by extruding and then withdrawing pseudopods. the little pushers came out of the goopy surface of the sphairikos and then were withdrawn into it completely. a raindrop falling in a pond makes a much more lasting mark than does the disappearing pseudopod of a sphairikos. but long ago in his boyhood one of the pseudopods of krug sixteen had not disappeared completely in every respect. there are several jokers waiting lay sister moira p. t. de c. announced a little later and perhaps some valid patients among them. its hard to tell. not another sphairikos the dookhdoctor asked in sudden anxiety. of course not. the one this morning is the only sphairikos who has ever come. how could there be anything wrong with him there is never anything wrong with a sphairikos. no these are all of the other species. just a regular morning bunch. so except for the visitation of the sphairikos it was a regular morning at the clinic. there were about a dozen waiting of the several species and at least half of them would be jokers. it was always so. there was a lean and giddy subula. one cannot tell the age or sex of them. but there was a tittering. in all human or inhuman expression whether of  sound color radioray or osmerhetor the titter suggests itself. it is just around the corner it is just outside it is subliminal but it is there somewhere. it is that my teeth hurt so terrible the subula shrilled so high that the dookhdoctor had to go on instruments to hear it. they are tromping pain. they are agony. i think i will cut my head off. have you a headoff cutter dookhdoctor let me see your teeth dookhdoctor drague asked with the beginnings of irritation. there is one tooth jump up and down with spike boot the subula shrilled. there is one jag like poisoned needle. there is one cuts like coarse rough saw. there is one burns like little hot fires. let me see your teeth the dookhdoctor growled evenly. there is one drills holes and sets little blasting powder in them the subula shrilled still more highly. then he sets them off. ow good night let me see your teeth peeef the subula shrilled. the teeth cascaded out half a bushel of them ten thousand of them all over the floor of the clinic. peeef the subula screeched again and ran out of the clinic. tittering but he should have remembered that the subula have no teeth. tittering it was the laughing of demented horses. it was the jackhammer braying of the dolcus it was the hysterical giggling of the ophis they were a half a bushel of shells of the little stink conches and they were already beginning to rot it was the clown laughter of the arktos the clinic would never be habitable again never mind he would burn it down and build another one tonight. the jokers the jokers they did have their fun with him and perhaps it did them some good. i have this trouble with me said a young dolcus but it make me so nervous to tell it. oh it do make me nervous to tell it to the dookhdoc. do not be nervous said the dookhdoctor fearing the worst. tell me your trouble in whatever way you can. i am here to serve every creature that is in any trouble or pain whatsoever. tell it. oh but it make me so nervous. i perish. i shrivel. i will have accident i am so nervous. tell me your trouble my friend. i am here to help. whoops whoops i already have accident i tell you i am nervous. the dolcus urinated largely on the clinic floor. then it ran out laughing. the laughing the shrilling the braying the shrill giggling that seemed to scrape the flesh from his bones. he should have remembered that the dolcus do not urinate everything comes from them hard and solid. the hooting the laughing it was a bag of green water from the kolmula swamp. even the aliens gagged at it and their laughter was of a pungent green sort. oh well there were several of the patients with real though small ailments and there were more jokers. there was the arktos whowait wait that particular jokerie cannot be told with human persons present even the subula and the ophis blushed lavender at the rawness of it. a thing like that can only be told to arktos themselves. and there was another dolcus who jokers jokers it was a typical morning at the clinic. one does whatever one can for the oneness that is greater than self. in the case of dookhdoctor drague it meant considerable sacrifice. one who works with the strange species here must give up all hope of material reward or material sophistication in his surroundings. but the dookhdoctor was a dedicated man. oh the dookhdoctor lived pleasantly and with a sort of artful simplicity and dynamic involvement in the small articles of life. he had an excited devotion and balanced intensity for corporate life. he lived in small houses of giolachweed woven with careful double rappel. he lived in each one for seven days only and then burned it and scattered the ashes taking always one bitter glob of them on his tongue for reminder of the fleetingness of temporal things and the wonderfulness of the returning. to live in one house for more than seven days is to become dull and habitual but the giolachweed will not burn well till it has been cut and plaited for seven days so the houses set their own terms. one half day to build seven days to inhabit one half day to burn ritually and scatter one renewal night under the speirsky. the dookhdoctor ate raibe or he ate innuin or ull or piorra when they were in season. and for the nine days of each year when none of these were in season he ate nothing at all. his clothing he made himself of colg. his paper was of the pailme plant. his printer used buaf ink and shaved slinn stone. everything that he needed he made for himself from things found wild in the hedgerows. he took nothing from the cultivated land or from the alien peoples. he was a poor and dedicated servant. now he stacked some of the needful things from the clinic and lay sister moira p. t. de c. took others of them to her own giolach house to keep till the next day. then the dookhdoctor ritually set his clinic on fire and a few moments later his house. this was all symbol of the great nostos the returning. he recited the great rhapsodies and other persons of the human kind came by and recited with him. that no least fiber of giolach die he recited that all enter immediately the more glorious and undivided life. that the ashes are the doorway and every ash is holy. that all become a part of the oneness that is greater than self. that no splinter of the giuis floorboards die that no glob of the chinking clay die that no mite or louse in the plaiting die. that all become a part of the oneness that is greater than self. he burned he scattered he recited he took one glob of bitter ash on his tongue. he experienced vicariously the great synthesis. he ate holy innuin and holy ull. and when it was finished both of the house and the clinic when it had come on night and he was homeless he slept that renewal night under the speirsky. and in the morning he began to build again the clinic first and then the house. it is the last of either that i shall ever build he said. the happy news about himself was that he was a dying man and that he would be allowed to take the short way out. so he built most carefully with the last building rites. he chinked both the buildings with special uir clay that would give a special bitterness to the ashes at the time of final burning. krug sixteen rolled along while the dookhdoctor still built his final clinic and the sphairikos helped him in the building while they consulted on the case of the screaming foot. krug sixteen could weave and plait and rappel amazingly with his pseudopods he could bring out a dozen of them a hundred thick or thin whatever was needed and all of a wonderful dexterity. that globe could weave. does the forgotten foot still suffer krug sixteen dookhdoctor drague asked it. it suffers its hysterical its in absolute terror. i dont know where it is it does not know and how i know about it at all is a mystery. have you found any way to help me to help it no. i am sorry but i have not. there is nothing in the literature on this subject no. nothing that i can identify as such. and you have not found analogy to it yes krug sixteen ah in a way i have discovered analogy. but it does not help you. or me. that is too bad dookhdoc. well i will live with it and the little foot will finally die with it. do i guess that your case is somewhat the same as mine no. my case is more similar to that of your lost foot than to you. well i will do what i can for myself and for it. its back to the old remedy then. but i am already covered deep with the twinkling salve. so am i krug sixteen in a like way. a i was ashamed of my affliction before and did not mention it. now however since i have spoken of it to you i have spoken of it to others also. there is some slight help i find. i should have shot off my big bazoo before. the sphairikoi have no bazoos. folkjoke dookhdoc. there is a special form of the twinkling salve. my own is insufficient so i will try the other. a special form of it krug sixteen i am interested in this. my own salve seems to have lost its effect. there is a girlfriend dookhdoc or a boyfriend person. how shall i say it it is a case four person to my case five. this person though promiscuous is expert. and this person exudes the special stuff in abundance. not quite my pot of ointment im afraid krug sixteen but it may be the answer for you. it is special and it dissolves everything including objections it is the most special of all the twinkling salves dookhdoc and it solves and dissolves everything. i believe it will reach my forgotten foot wherever it is and send it into kind and everlasting slumber. it will know that it is itself that slumbers and that will be bearable. if i were notahgoing out of business krug sixteen id get a bit of it and try to analyze it. what is the name of this special case four person torchy twelve is its name. yes. i have heard of her.    everybody now knew that it was the last week in the life of the dookh doctor and everyone tried to make his happiness still more happy. the morning jokers outdid themselves especially the arktos. after all he was dying of an arktos disease one never fatal to the arktos themselves. they did have some merry and outrageous times around the clinic and the dookh doctor got the sneaky feeling that he would rather live than die. he hadnt it was plain to see the right attitude. so lay priest migma p. t. de c. tried to inculcate the right attitude in him. it is the great synthesis you go to dookhdoctor he said. it is the happy oneness that is greater than self. oh i know that but you put it on a little too thick. ive been taught it from my babyhood. im resigned to it. resigned to it you should be ecstatic over it the self must perish of course but it will live on as an integral atom of the evolving oneness just as a drop lives on in the ocean. aye migma but the drop may hang onto the memory of the time when it was cloud of the time when it was falling drop indeed of the time when it was brook. it may say theres too damned much salt in this ocean. im lost here. oh but the drop will want to be lost dookhdoctor. the only purpose of existence is to cease to exist. and there cannot be too much of salt in the evolving oneness. there cannot be too much of anything. all must be one in it. salt and sulfur must be one undifferentiated. offal and soul must become one. blessed be oblivion in the oneness that collapses on itself. stuff it lay priest. im weary of it. stuff it you say i dont understand your phrase but im sure its apt. yes yes dookhdoctor stuff it all in animals people rocks grass worlds and wasps. stuff it all in. that all may be obliterated into the greatmay i not coin a word even as the master coined theminto the great stuffiness im afraid your word is all too apt. دور  it is the great quintessence it is the happy death of all individuality and memory it is the synthesis of all living and dead things into the great amorphism. it is the it is the old old salve and its lost its twinkle the dookhdoctor said sadly. how goes the old quotation when the salve becomes sticky how then will you come unstuck no the dookhdoctor did not have the right attitude so it was necessary that many persons should harass him into it. time was short. his death was due. and there was the general fear that the dookhdoctor might not be properly lost. he surely came to his time of happiness in grumpy fashion. the week was gone by. the last evening for him was come. the dookh doctor ritually set his clinic on fire and a few minutes later his house. he burned he scattered he recited the special lasttime recital. he ate holy innuin and holy ull. he took one glob of most bitter ash on his tongue and he lay down to sleep his last night under the speirsky. he wasnt afraid to die. i will cross that bridge gladly but i want there to be another side to that bridge he talked to himself. and if there is no other side of it i want it to be me who knows that there is not. they say pray that you be happily lost forever. pray for blessed obliteration. i will not pray that i be happily lost forever. i would rather burn in a hell forever than suffer happy obliteration ill burn if it be me that burns. i want me to be me. i will refuse forever to surrender myself. it was a restless night for him. well perhaps he could die easier if he were wearied and sleepless at dawn. other men dont make such a fuss about it he told himself the self he refused to give up. other men are truly happy in obliteration. why am i suddenly different other men desire to be lost lost lost. how have i lost the faith of my childhood and manhood what is unique about me there was no answer to that. whatever is unique about me i refuse to give it up. i will howl and moan against that extinction for billions of centuries. ah i will go sly i will devise a sign so i will know me if i meet me again. about an hour before dawn the lay priest migma p. t. de c. came to dookh doctor drague. the dolcus and the arktos had reported that the man was resting badly and was not properly disposed. i have an analogy that may ease your mind dookhdoctor the lay priest whispered softly ease it into great easiness salve it into great salving begone fellow your salve has lost its twinkle. consider that we have never lived that we have only seemed to live. consider that we do not die but are only absorbed into great selfless self. consider the odd sphairikoi of this world what about the sphairikoi i consider them often. i believe that they are set here for our instruction. a sphairikos is a total globe the type of the great oneness. then consider that it sometimes ruffles its surface extrudes a little falsefoot from its soft surface. would it not be odd if that falsefoot for its brief second considered itself a person would you not laugh at that no no. i do not laugh. and the dookhdoctor was on his feet. and in much less than a second that pseudopod is withdrawn back into the sphere of the sphairikoi. so it is with our lives. nothing dies. it is only a ripple on the surface of the oneness. can you entertain so droll an idea as that the pseudopod should remember or wish to remember yes. ill remember it a billion years for the billion who forget. the dookhdoctor was running uphill in the dark. he crashed into trees and boles as though he wished to remember the crashing forever. ill burn before i forget but i must have something that says its me who burns up up by the spherical hills of the sphairikoi bawling and stumbling in the dark. up to a hut that had a certain fame he could never place to the hut a that had its own identity that sparkled with identity. open open help me the dookhdoctor cried out at the last hut on the hill. go away man the last voice protested. all my clients are gone and the night is almost over with. what has this person to do with a human man anyhow it was a round twinkling voice out of the roweled dark. but there was enduring identity there. the twinkling enduringidentity colors coming from the chinks of the hut had not reached the level of vision. there was even the flicker of the iwillknowmeifimeetmeagain color. torchy twelve help me. i am told that you have the special salve that solves the last problem and makes it know that it is always itself that is solved. why it is the dookhdoc why have you come to torchy i want something to send me into kind and everlasting slumber he moaned. but i want it to be me who slumbers. cannot you help me in any way come you in the dookhdoc. this person though promiscuous is expert. i help you the world as will and wallpaper introduction by samuel r. delany along with the primary education of the camiroi this was one of the first tales by raphael aloysius lafferty 1914–2002 i read. where it appeared however i have no notion. possibly thats because today i know so much more about the intellectual context that informs his story than i did when i first read it and it is easy to let the context overwhelm the tale. one suspects that is part of the storys project. but in whose anthology–judith merrils terry carrsi first read this piece i have no notion at all. i once taught a clarion workshop at tulane where the students included george r. r. martin and i wondered if somehow lafferty himself might be in evidence. he wasnt. and the class was in some confusion because the young man who had set up the whole thing had also pulled out at the last minute. its interesting that even at that time lafferty as a myth was so in evidence. but what of the tale to hand william morris 1834–1896 was intelligent rich and multitalented. he was a committed socialist and the author of a number of fantasies including news from nowhere and the world beyond the wood. he supported a number of other artists including edward burnejones and he designed ornate wallpapers still used today as well he printed sumptuous illustrated editions of books such as the kelmscott works of geoffrey chaucer. he is one of the most writtenabout men of his times and he is the avatar of the hero of laffertys futuristic tale of a trip through the city of the world. as much or more than any famous victorian figure its easy to see how the nature of morriss fame is entirely an accident of a social position. laffertys title riffs on the german philosopher arthur schopenhauers 1788–1860 twovolume philosophical treatise the world as will and representation. schopenhauer is known for the extreme pessimism of his philosophy and the beauty of his writing. like a wallace shawn play laffertys tale takes place in a stressed future and moves from there to its distressing end. the story begins from a seeming commonsense challenge to the classical description of a city straight out of jane jacobs a concentration of persons that is not economically selfcontained... and sets it at the limit of its growth the world city is economically selfcontained. by the storys end laffertys own pessimism is running neck and neck with schopenhauers. laffertys catholicism was a topic often referred to by fans and critics the other writer who sits in my mind as a severely lapsed catholic is thomas disch. and i wonder to what extent that can be read as part of the cultural context that informs both writers. laffertys is a story of bookies and talkies and readies where the world city is a tidy place because it tips and tilts with the tides it floats on and willy whose name game is based on william morris goes to explore with kandy kalosh and later fairhair farquhar the world city which is of course much too large for them to see more than a fraction ofthough what of it thats revealed with each narrative move is more and more distressing. in all the world as will and wallpaper offers a grim view of what a world as it approaches its end times requires to be selfsustaining. a the world as will and wallpaper a template a stencil a plan. corniest orniest damsel and man orderly emptily passion and pity alltheworld alltheworld alltheworld city. 13th street ballad a there is an old dictionaryencyclopedia that defines a city as ... a concentration of persons that is not economically selfcontained. the dictionaryencyclopedia being an old one however and there is no other kind is mistaken. the world city is economically selfcontained. it was william morris who read this definition in the old book. william was a bookie or readie and he had read parts of several books. but now he had a thought if all the books are old then things may no longer be as the books indicate. i will go out and see what things are like today in the city. i will traverse as much of the city as my life allows me. i may even come to the wood beyond the world that my namegame ancestor described. william went to the permit office of the city. since there was only one city there might be only one permit office though it was not large. i want a permit to traverse as much of the city as my life allows me william told the permit man. i even want a permit to go to the wood beyond the world. is that possible the permit man did a little skittish dance around william like a one eyed gander around a rattlesnake. the metaphor was an old and honored one one of the fiftyfour common metaphors. they both understood it it didnt have to be voiced. william was the first customer the permit man had had in many days though so the visit startled him. since everything is permitted you will need no permit the permit man said. go man go. why are you here then william asked him. if there are no permits why is there a permit office this is my niche and my notch the permit man said. do away with me and my office and you begin to do away with the city itself. it is the custom to take a companion when you traverse the city. outside william found a companion named kandy kalosh and they began to traverse the city that was the world. they began it was no more than coincidence at a marker set in stone that bore the words beginning of stencil 35352. the city tipped and tilted a bit and they were on their way. now this is what the city was like it was named will of the world city for it had been constructed by a great and worldwide surge of creative will. afterward something had happened to that surge but it did not matter the city was already created then. the city was varied it was joyful it was free and it covered the entire world. the mountains and heights had all been removed and the city with its various strips of earth and sweet water and salt water floated on the ocean on its interlocking floaters. as to money values everything was free and everything was free as to personal movement and personal choice. it was not really crowded except in the places where the people wanted it crowded for people do love to congregate. it was sufficient as to foodstuff and shelter and entertainment. these things have always been free really it was their packaging and traffic that cost and now the packaging and traffic were virtually eliminated. work is joy flashed the subliminal signs. of course it is. it is a joy to stop and turn into an area and work for an hour even an hour and a half at some occupation never or seldom attempted before. william and kandy entered an area where persons made cloth out of clamshells softening them in one solution then drawing them out to filaments on a machine then forming not weaving them into cloth on still another machine. the cloth was not needed for clothing or for curtains though sometimes it was used for  one or the other. it was for ornamentation. temperature did not require cloth the temperature was everywhere equitable and modesty did not require it but there was something that still required a little cloth as ornament. william and kandy worked for nearly an hour with other happy people on the project. it is true that their own production was all stamped rejected when they were finished but that did not mean that it went all the way back to the clamshells only back to the filament stage. honest labor is never lost william said as solemnly as a onehorned owl with the pip. i knew you were a readie but i didnt know you were a talkie kandy said. people didnt talk much then. happy people have no need to talk. and of course honest labor is never lost and small bits of it are pleasurable. this portion of the city perhaps all portions of the city floated on an old ocean itself. it had therefore a slight heave to it all the time. the city is a tidy place was an old and honored saying. it referred to the fact that the city moved a little with the tides. it was a sort of joke. the two young persons came ten blocks they came a dozen. for much of this traverse the city had been familiar to william but not to kandy. they had been going west and william had always been a westing lad. kandy however had always wandered east from her homes and she was the farthest west that she had ever been when she met william. they came to the 14th street water ballet and watched the swimmers. these swimmers were very good and great numbers of curiously shaped fish frolicked with them in the green saltfresh pools. anyone who wished to could of course swim in the water ballet but most of the swimmers seemed to be regulars. they were part of the landscape of the waterscape. william and kandy stopped to eat at an algaeandplankton quicklunch place on 15th street. indeed kandy worked there for half an hour pressing the plankton and adding squirts of special protein as the people ordered it. kandy had worked in quicklunch places before. the two of them stopped at the will of the world exhibit hall on 16th street. they wrote their names with a stylus in wax when they went in or rather william wrote the names of both of them for kandy could not write. and because he bore the mystic name of william he received a card out of the slot with a genuine will of the world verse on it this city of the world is wills of willful folk and nothing daunts it. with daring hearts we hewed the hills to make the world as willy wants it. really had it taken such great will and heart to build the city of the world it must have or there would not have been a will of the world exhibit hall to commend it. there were some folks however who said that the building of the world city had been an automatic response. kandy being illiterate as the slot knew received a picture card. they stopped at the cliffdweller complex on 17th street. this part of the city was new to william as well as to kandy. the cliffs and caves were fabricated and not natural cliff dwellings but they looked very much as old cliff dwellings must have looked. there were little ladders going up from one level to the next. there were people sitting on the little terraces with the smallwindowed apartments behind them. due to the circular arrangement of the cliff dwellings very many of the people were always visible to one another. the central courtyard was like an amphitheater. young people played stickball and indian ball in this area. they made music on drums and whistles. there were artificial rattlesnakes in coils artificial ribskinny dogs artificial coyotes artificial women in the act of grinding corn with hand querns. and also in little shelters or pavilions there were real people grinding simulacrum corn on apparatus. kandy kalosh went into one of the pavilions and ground corn for fifteen minutes. she had a healthy love for work. william morris made corndogs out of simulacrum corn and seaweeds. it was pleasant there. sometimes the people sang simulacrum indian songs. there were patterned blankets brightly colored and woven out of bindweed. there were buffoons in masks and buffoon suits who enacted injokes and insituations that were understood by the cliffdwelling people only but they could be enjoyed by everyone. all different all different every block different william murmured in rapture. it had come on evening but evening is a vague thing. it was never very bright in the daytime or very dark at night. the world city hadnt a clear sky but it had always a sort of diffused light. william and kandy traveled still farther west. it is wonderful to be a world traveler and to go on forever william exulted. the city is so huge that we cannot see it all in our whole lives and every bit of it is different. a talkie you are kandy said. however did i get a talkie if i were a talkie too i could tell you something about that everypartofitisdifferent bit. this is the greatest thing about the whole world city william sang to travel the city itself for all our lives and the climax of it will be to see the wood beyond the world. but what happens then kandy the city goes on forever covering the whole sphere. it cannot be bounded. what is beyond the wood beyond the world if i were a talkie i could tell you kandy said. but the urge to talk was on william morris. he saw an older and somehow more erect man who wore an armband with the lettering monitor on it. of course only a readie or bookie like william would have been able to read the word. my namegame ancestor had to do with the naming as well as the designing of the wood beyond the world william told the erect and smiling man for i also am a william morris. i am avid to see this ultimate wood. it is as though i have lived for the moment. if you will it strongly enough then you may see it willy the man said. but i am puzzled william worried out the words and his brow was furrowed. what is beyond the wood beyond the world a riddle but an easy one. the man smiled. how is it that you are a readie and do not know such simple things cannot you give me a clue to the easy riddle william begged. yes the man said. your namegame ancestor had to do with the designing of one other particular thing besides the wood beyond the world. come along readie come along kandy said. they went to the west side show square on 18th street. neither of them had ever been to such a place but they had heard rumors of it for there is nothing at all like the west side show square on 18th street. there were the great amplifiers with plugins everywhere. not only were the instruments plugged in but most of the people were themselves plugged in. and ah the wonderful setting was like the backside of old tenements all together in a rough circuit. there were period fire escapes that may even have » been accurate. they looked as though persons might actually climb up and down on them. indeed light persons had actually done this in the past but it was forbidden now as some of the folks had fallen to death or maiming. but the atmosphere was valid. listen there was period washing on period clotheslines it was flapped by little wind machines just as though there were a real wind blowing. no wonder they called this the show square. it was a glumslum a jettoghetto authentic past time. the performing people and all the people on that part of 18th street seemed to be performing people were dressed in tight jeans and scalloped or ragged shirts and even in broken shoes full of holes. it must have been very hot for them but art is worth it. it was a memento of the time when the weather was not everywhere equitable. there were indramas and injokes and insituations acted out. the essence of the little dramas was very intense hatred for a group or class not clearly defined. there were many of those oldperiod enemy groups in the various drama locations of the city. the lights were without pattern but they were bright. the music was without tune or melody or song or chord but it was very loud and very passionate. the shouting that took the place of singing was absolutely livid. some of the performers fell to the ground and writhed there and foamed at their mouths. it was a thing to be seen and heardonce. william and kandy finally took their leave with bleeding ears and matterencrusted eyes. they went along to 19th street where there was a minglemangle. it was now as dark as it ever got in the city but the mangle was well lighted. certain persons at the mangle laughingly took hold of william and kandy and married them to each other. they had bride and groom crowns made of paper and they put them on their heads. then they wined and dined them an old phrase. really they were given fine cognac made of fish serum and braised meat made of algae but also mixed with the real chopped flesh of ancients. then william and kandy padded down in the great pad palace that was next to the mangle. every night there were great numbers of people along that part of 19th street at the minglemangle and at the pad palace and most of these folks were friendly with their glazed eyes and their dampish grins. in the morning kandy kalosh wanted to return to her home even though it was nearly twenty blocks to the eastward. william watched her go without the worlds resources are consumed disproportionately by the intelligent classes. therefore we will keep our own numbers drastically reduced. the wanwits have not strong reproductive or consuming urge so long as they are kept in reasonable comfort and sustenance. they are happy they are entertained and when they are convinced that there is no more for them to see they become the ancients and go willingly to the choppers. but the 2 percent or so of us superior ones are necessary to run the world. why then do we keep the others the simpleminded billions we keep them for the same reason that our ancestors kept blooms or lands or animals or great houses or trees or artifacts. we keep them because we want to and because there is no effort involved. but a great effort was made once. there was an incredible surge of will. mountains were moved and leveled. the sky itself was pulled down as it were. the will of the world was made manifest. it was a new act of creation. and what is the step following creation when it is discovered that the commonality is not worthy of the city created when it is discovered also that they are the logical cattle to fill such great pens the next step is hierarchies. the angels themselves have hierarchies and we are not less. it is those who are intelligent but not quite intelligent enough to join the club who are imperiled and destroyed as a necessity to the operation of the city. at the summit is always the club. it is the club in the sense of a bludgeon and also of an organization. will of the world annalsclassified

street ballad sorrow. he would get a westering girl to go with him on the lifelong exploration of the endlessly varied city. he might get a girl who was a talkie or even a readie or bookie. and he did. she was named fairhair farquhar though she was actually dark of hair and of surface patina. but they started out in the early morning to attain whether in a day or a lifetime the wood beyond the world. but it is not far at all fairhair said she was a talkie. we can reach it this very evening. we can sleep in the wood in the very night shadow of the famous muggers. oh is the morning not wonderful a blue patch was seen only last week a real hole in the sky. maybe we can see another. they did not see another. it is very seldom that a blue or even a starry hole can be seen in the greenhouse glass–gray color that is the sky. the will of the world had provided sustenance for everyone but it was a muggy and sticky world city that provided almost equally warm from pole to pole cloyingly fertile in both the land strips and the water strips and now just a little bit queasy. run william run in the morning fairhair cried and she ran while he shuffled after her. fairhair did not suffer morning sickness but most of the world did it had not yet been bred out of the races. after all it was a very tidy world. there was a great membrane or firmament built somewhere below and old ocean was prisoned between this firmament and the fundamental rock of gehennaearth. but the oceanmonster tossed and pitched and was not entirely tamed he was still old leviathan. along and behind all the streets of the world city were the narrow their width not five times the length of a man strips strips of very nervous and incredibly fertile land of salt water jumping with fish and eels and dark with tortoise and so thick with bluegreen plankton that one could almost walk on it of fresh water teeming with other fish and loggy with snapping turtles and snakes of other fresh water almost solid with nourishing algae of mixed water filled with purged shrimp and all old estuary life land strips again and strips of rich chemical water where people voided themselves and their used things and from which so many valuable essences could be extracted other strips and then the houses and buildings of another block for the blocks were not long. kaleidoscope of nervous water and land everywhere basic and everywhere different boated with boats on the strange overpass canals crossed by an infinity of bridges. and no two alike william sang his morning sickness having left him. every one different everything different in a world that cannot be traversed in a lifetime. well not run out of wonders william william there is something i have been meaning to tell you fairhair tried to interpose. tell me fairhair what is beyond the wood beyond the world since the world is a globe without bounds the world beyond the wood is beyond the wood beyond the world fairhair said simply. if you want the wood you will come to it but do not be cast down if it falls short for you. how could it fall short for me i am a william morris. my namegame ancestor had to do with the naming as well as the designing of the wood. your namegame ancestor had to do with the designing of another thing also fairhair said. why that was almost the same thing as the monitor man had said the day before. what did they mean by it william and fairhair came to the great chopper house at 20th street. the two of them went in and worked for an hour in the chopper house. you do not understand this do you little william fairhair asked. oh i understand enough for me. i understand that it is everywhere different. yes i suppose you understand enough for you fairhair said with a touch of near sadness. what they chopped up in the chopper house was the ancients. they went on and on along the strips and streets of the ever changing city. they came to 21st street and 22nd and 23rd. even a writie could not write down all the marvels that were to be found at every street. it is sheer wonder to be a world traveler. there was a carnival at 23rd street. there were barkies sharkies sparkies darkies parkies and markies the visitors were the markies but it was not really bad for them. there was the very loud music even though it was supposed to be period tingletangle or rinkydink. there was a steam calliope with real live steam. there were the hamburger stands with the wonderful smell of a touch of garlic in the open air no matter that it was ancient chopper meat and crinoidroot bun from which the burgers were made. there were games of chance smooch houses and cooch houses whirly rides and turning wheels wino and steino bars and bordellos and monster and misbegotten displays in clamshellcloth tents. really is anyone too old to enjoy a carnival then let that one declare himself an ancient and turn himself in to a chopper house. but on and on one does not tarry when there is the whole world city to see and it not be covered in one lifetime. on 24th or was it 25th street were the flesh pots and a little beyond them was the cat center. one ate and drank beyond reason in the flesh pots region and also became enmeshed in the flesh mesh booths. and one catted beyond reason in the honeycomblike cubicles of the cat center. fairhair went and worked for an hour at the cat center she seemed to be known and popular there. but on and on everywhere it is different and everywhere it is better. along about 27th and 28th streets were the top of the town and night life knoll those great cabaret concentrations. it was gindizzy here it was yesterday and tomorrow entangled with its great expectations and its overpowering nostalgia it was loud as the west side show square it was as direct as the minglemangle or the pad palace. it was as fleshy as the flesh pots and more catty than the catcenter. oh it was the jumpingest bunch of places that william had yet seen in the city. something a little sad there though something of passion and pity that was too empty and too pat. it was as though this were the climax of it all and one didnt want it to be the climax yet. it was as if the top of the town and nightlife knoll and not the wood beyond the world were the central things of the world city. perhaps william slept there awhile in the sadness that follows the surfeit of flesh and appetite. there were other doings and sayings about him but mostly his eyes were closed and his head was heavy. but then fairhair had him up again and rushing toward the wood in the still early night. it is only a block william it is only a block she sang and it is the place you have wanted more than any other. the wood began at 29th street and went on it was said for the space of two full blocks. but william ran badly and he even walked badly. he was woozy and confused not happy not sad just full of the great bulk of life in the city. hed hardly have made it to his high goal that night except for the help of fairhair. but she dragged and lifted and carried him along in her fine arms and on her dusky back and shoulders. he toppled off sometimes and cracked his crown but there was never real damage done. one sometimes enters the wood beyond in a sort of rhythmic dream grotesque and comic and jolting with the sway of a strong friend and of the tidy world itself. and william came in with his arms around the neck and shoulders of the girl named fairhair with his face buried in her hair itself with his feet touching no ground. but he knew it as soon as they were in the wood. he was afoot again and strong again in the middle of the fabled place itself. he was sober no there can be no sobriety in the wood it has its own intoxication. but it had real grass and weeds real trees though most of them were bushes real beasts as well as artificial real spruce cones on the turf real birds no matter that they were clattering crows coming in to roost. there was the carven oak figure of old robin hood and the tall sparwood form of the giant lumberjack paul bunyan. there was the red indian named white deer who was carved from cedarwood. there was maple syrup dripping from the trees is that the way they used to get it and there was the aroma of slippery elm with the night dampness on it. there were the famous muggers from the mugger decades. they were of papiermâché it is true and yet they were the most fearsome. there were other dangerous beasts in the wood but none like the muggers. and william and fairhair lay down and wept in the very night shadow of the famous muggers for the remainder of the enchanted night. 3. wanderbird wanderbird where do you fly all over the city all under the sky. run william run in the morning fairhair cried and she ran while william confused from the night shuffled after her. we must leave the wood he asked. wandring through wonders of strippies and streets changing and challenging bitters and sweets. wanderbird squanderbird should not have budged city is sicko and sky is a smudge. 1st street ballad of course you must leave the wood. you want to see the whole world so you cannot stay in one place. you go on i go back. no no dont you look back or youll be turned into a saltwood tree. stay with me fairhair. no no you want variety. i have been with you long enough. i have been guide and companion and pony to you. now we part. fairhair went back. william was afraid to look after her. he was in the world beyond the wood beyond the world. he noticed though that the street was 1st street and not 31st street as he had expected. it was still wonderful to be a world traveler of course but not quite as wonderful as it had been one other time. the number of the street shouldnt have mattered to him. william had not been on any 1st street before. or 2nd. but he had been on a 3rd street before on his farthest trip east. should he reach it again on his farthest trip west the world he knew being a readie who had read parts of several books was larger than that. he could not have gone around it in thirty blocks. still he came to 3rd street in great trepidation. ah it was not the same 3rd street he had once visited before almost the same but not exactly. an ounce of reassurance was intruded into the tons of alarm in his heavy head. but he was alive he was well he was still traveling west in the boundless city that is everywhere different. the city is varied and joyful and free william morris said boldly and it is everywhere different. then he saw kandy kalosh and he literally staggered with the shock. only it did not quite seem to be she. is your name kandy kalosh he asked as quakingly as a onelegged kangaroo with the willies. the last thing i needed was a talkie she said. of course it isnt. my name which i have from my namegame ancestor is candy calabash not at all the same. of course it wasnt the same. then why had he been so alarmed and disappointed will you travel westward with me candy he asked. i suppose so a little way if we dont have to talk she said. so william morris and candy calabash began to traverse the city that was the world. they began it was no more than coincidence at a marker set in stone that bore the words beginning of stencil 35353 and thereat william went into a sort of panic. but why should he it was not the same stencil number at all. the world city might still be everywhere different. but william began to run erratically. candy stayed with him. she was not a readie or a talkie but she was faithful to a companion for many blocks. the two young persons came ten blocks they came a dozen. they arrived at the 14th street water ballet and watched the swimmers. it was almost but not quite the same as another 14th street water ballet that william had seen once. they came to the algaeandplankton quicklunch place on 15th street and to the will of the world exhibit hall on 16th street. ah a hopeful eye could still pick out little differences in the huge sameness. the world city had to be everywhere different. they stopped at the cliffdweller complex on 17th street. there was an artificial antelope there now. william didnt remember it from the other time. there was hope there was hope. and soon william saw an older and somehow more erect man who wore an armband with the word monitor on it. he was not the same man but he had to be a close brother of another man that william had seen two days before. does it all repeat itself again and again and again william asked this man in great anguish. are the sections of it the same over and over again not quite the man said. the grease marks on it are sometimes a little different. my name is william morris william began once more bravely. oh sure. a william morris is the easiest type of all to spot the man said. you saidno another man said that my namegame ancestor had to do with designing of another thing besides the wood beyond the world william stammered. what was it wallpaper the man said. and william fell down in a frothy faint. oh candy didnt leave him there. she was faithful. she took him up on her shoulders and plodded along with him on past the west side show square on 18th street past the minglemangle and the pad palace where she no another girl very like her had turned back before on and on. its the same thing over and over and over again william whimpered as she toted him along. be quiet talkie she said but she said it with some affection. they came to the great chopper house on 20th street. candy carried william in and dumped him on a block there. hes become ancient candy told an attendant. boy how hes become ancient it was more than she usually talked. then as she was a fairminded girl and as she had not worked any stint that day she turned to and worked an hour in the chopper house. what they chopped up in the chopper house was the ancients. why there was williams head coming down the line candy smiled at it. she chopped it up with loving care much more care than she usually took. shed have said something memorable and kind if shed been a talkie. a funnyfingers introduction by andrew ferguson ask a few readers of lafferty what they treasure him for and youll get a lot of the same answers. he will make you laugh uproariously. he will show you new possibilities inherent in languagenot just in english but many others as well. he will provide you a vantage point on this world and other worlds to boot that flips you inside out inverting everything you thought you knew about the workings of fiction. what they wont mention as oftenpartly because he doesnt do it that much and partly because it hurts so much when he doesis that he will break your heart wide open. funnyfingers is at its most basic level a tale of doomed love. it isnt spoiling anything to say that in an introduction either because as he often does lafferty tells us whats going to happen right from the start. here its in an epigram alluding to orpheus something you dont do unless a eurydice is about to be lost. with admirable narrative economy the main character immediately thereafter poses the central question that will lead to her romantic impassewho or what am iand then the reader is given several valid answers she is a somewhat exasperating and precocious little girl and she is also a young dactyl a creature of myth one of a number who gave humankind ironworking arithmetic and the alphabet and who in their adult years remain responsible for manufacturing letters and numbers and pieces for the entire world. the story plays out from there though the narrative beats and resolution are hardly formulaic. however lafferty is as usual concerned with much more than just the central relationship of his unhappy couple hes exploring a humanitys relationship with its stories as well as his own particular relation as a channel for those myths. while laffertys personal relationship experience was limited to what he could glean from others he nonetheless understood that much of what we love about another is the stories we construct around them myths that are deeply personal even as they partake of the universal. but when what you love is a storyor you yourself are a story the deck is stacked against you from the start. as the young lovers in funnyfingers realize to their dismay our stories will outlive us and in particular they will outlive their own tellers. the result is a curious if typically laffertian inversion of the orpheus legend its not the stories who must be left behind to the darkness but us. when oread funnyfingers traipses through the mine assembling iron dogs or iron boys or iron philosophies its us shes putting together. and when she disassembles them at the end of play its us she puts back in the sparepart bins. and in the end though we too feel heartbreak at the conclusion of our alltoobrief parts it is oread and it is pluto the stories themselves who will weep iron tears. who am i oread funnyfingers asked her mother one day and for that matter what am i why you are our daughter the mother frances funnyfingers told her or have you been talking to someone only to myself and to my uncles in the mountain. oh. now first dear i want you to know that we love you very much. there was nothing casual about it. we chose you and you are to us oh take it easy mother. i know that im adopted. and im sure that you both love me very much you tell me so often enough. but what am i really you are a little girl oread a somewhat exasperating and precocious little girl. but i dont feel precocious. i feel like a rockhead. how can i be a little bit like papa and not anything like anyone else at all what was the connection between myself and papa there wasnt any at first oread not like that. we were looking for a child since we could not have one of our own. i fell in love with you at first sight because you reminded me of henry. and henry fell in love with you at first sight because you reminded him of henry. henry was always the favorite person of both myself and henry. thats a joke dear. but not entirely my husband is so delightfully boyish and selfcentered. now run out and play. funnyfingers and pluto lord of hell wept when orpheus played to him that lovely phrase from gluckbut these were iron tears. h. belloc on tears of the great no i think ill run in and play. oh but its so dark and dirty and smoky in there. and its so light and unsmoky everywhere else mama oread said and she ran inside the mountain to play. well the house and the shop of henry funnyfingers backed onto the mountain. it was really only a low but steep foothill to the osage hills. this was on the northwest fringe of the city. the shop was the typewriter repair shop of henry the father of oread. you wouldnt know that from the sign out front though. the sign said daktylographs repaired here henry funnyfingers. the shop part of the building was half into and under the hill. behind the shop was a dimly lit parts room that was entirely under the hill. and behind this were other parts rooms one after the other rockwalled and dark rockier and darker as one went on all deep under the hills. and these continued on and on as tunnel and cavern without apparent end. in these places of total darkness if only one knew where to reach in which pot there was to be found every part for every sort of machine in the world or so henry funnyfingers said. oread ran through room after room through passage after passage in the blackness. she drew parts from the pots and the furnaces as she ran. she put the parts together and it barked remindfully. what have i forgotten oread asked. ah rusty ive given you only one ear. im sorry. she took the other ear from the other ear pot as she ran past and she put it on him. then she had an iron dog complete. it would run and play and bark after her in the tunnels under the mountain. oh kelmis oh acmon oh damnae all three come out of the mountain and play with me. oread sang that. sometimes the three mountain uncles were busy they had to make numbers and letters and pieces for the whole world and couldnt come to play. but almost always one of them came and kelmis came today. kelmis was the smoky smelly one but oread didnt mind that. he was full of stories he was full of fun he was full of the hot darknessfire from which anything can be made. it was great fun there through all the afternoon and evening as they are called out in the light. but then kelmis had to go back to work. oread and the iron dog rusty ran back up the passages toward the house. she took the dog apart as they went back and put each piece into its proper pot. last of all she put its bark in the bark pot and she came up through the shop and into the inside of the house for supper. oh oread however do you get so smoky and smelly mother frances funnyfingers asked her. why dont you play out in the sunshine like other girls do why dont you play with other girls and boys i made an iron boy to play with once mama oread said. you wouldnt believe how he carried on or the things he wanted to do. i had the devils own time taking him apart again. thats the last boy i ever make i tell you. theyre tricky. yes as i remember it they are frances conceded. whatever do you make your stories out of oread oh i make them out of iron oread told her seriously. iron is what everything is made out of first. the pieces are all there in the pots and the furnaces. you just put them together. pieces of stories oread oh yes.  iron stories girl oh yes yes iron stories. you are funnyfingers and funnyface and funnybrains the mother told her. i think ill have you eat your supper off an iron plate with iron spoon and knife. oh may i ill go make them oread cried. make me a set while youre at it father henry funnyfingers said. no oread. sit down and eat your supper from what we have both of you. frances funnyfingers loved her husband and her daughter but sometimes they puzzled her. we cannot honestly say that oread grew up we can hardly say that she grew older. she finally started school when she was nine years old and she looked as though she were four or five. going to school was only for seemliness anyhow. oread already knew everything. she got on well. she was a peculiar little girl but she didnt know it. she gave disconcerting answers in class but nobody could say that they were wrong answers. what difference does it make which end you start and answer at she was a strange smiling little girl and she was liked by most of her schoolmates. those who didnt like her feared her and why should anyone fear so small a creature as oread funnyfingers they feared her because she said be good to me or ill make an iron wolf to eat you up. she would have done it and they knew she would have done it. and she always got her homework and got it right. she had what seemed to her mother an unscholarly way of doing it though. she would take her books or her printed assignments. she would walk singing through the shop through the parts room through the other parts rooms behind that and down into the passages in the toes of the hills. oh kelmis oh acmon oh damnae all three make ready all pots where the answers may be. oread would sing so. then she would pick the iron answers out of the answer pots. shed put them together by subjects. she would stamp them onto her papers and they would mark all the answers correct in her handwriting. so she would have the catechism the composition the questions on the reading the arithmetic all perfect. then shed drop all the iron answers back into the answer pots where they would melt themselves down to iron slag again. dont you think thats cheating her mother would ask her. what if all the other children got their homework that way they couldnt unless they were funnyfingers oread said. the hot iron answers would burn their hands clear off unless they were funnyfingers. no it isnt cheating. its just knowing your subject. i guess so then mother frances said. there were so many things she didnt understand about her husband henry hes boyish like a boy like an iron boy shed say and about her daughter shes like an owl like a little owl a little iron owl. neither henry nor oread liked the daylight very much but they always faced it as bravely as they could. one day oread found her mother in tears yet there was happy salt in them. look the mother frances said. she had a valentine an iron valentine that henry had given her. there was an iron heart on it and an iron verse  a when you are dead five hundred years who once were full of life ill think of you with salty tears and take another wife. oh its nice mama oread said. but of iron frances asked. oh yes the very first rimes were made out of iron you know. and what of the five hundred years i think its considerate that he would wait five hundred years after you die to take another wife. yes i suppose so oread. but frances wasnt completely at ease with her family. henry always made a good living from his typewriter repair shop or rather  he made a good living from his parts stocks in the rooms behind. other dealers and repairmen not just of typewriters but of everything came to him for parts. his prices were reasonable and there was never a part that he didnt have. a dealer would rattle off the catalog number of something for a tractor or a haybaler or a dishwasher. just a minute henry funnyfingers would say and he would plunge into his mysterious back rooms. he had a comical little song he would croon to himself as he went oh kelmis oh acmon oh damnae all three now this is the number oh make it for me and in a second with the last word of the song just out of his mouth hed be back with the required part still hot in his hand. he never missed. parts of combines parts of electric motors parts for fords he could come up with all of them instantly with only a catalog number or the broken piece itself or even a vague description to go on. and he did repair typewriters quicker and better than anyone in town. he wasnt rich he was fearful of becoming rich but he did well and nobody in the funnyfinger family wanted for anything. when they were in the sixth grade oread had a boyfriend. he was a syrian boy named selim elia. he was dark and he was handsome. he looked the veriest little bit as though he were made of iron that was the main reason that oread liked him. and he seemed to suspect entirely too much about the funnyfingers she thought that was a reason that shed better like him. when you grow up oh oread will you ever grow up im going to marry you selim said boldly. of course ill grow up. doesnt everyone oread said. but you wont be able to marry me. why not little horned owl i dont know. i just feel that we wont be grown up at the same time. hurry up then little ironeyes little basiliskeyes selim said. i will marry you. they got along well. selim was very protective of little oread. they liked each other. what is wrong with people liking each other when in the eighth grade oread made a discovery about sister mary dactyl the art teacher for all the grades. sister mary d seemed to be very young. but she cant be that young oread told selim. some of the mythological things she draws theyve been gone a long time. she has to be old to have seen them. oh she draws them from old stories and old descriptions selim said or she just draws them out of her imagination. a couple of them she didnt draw out of her imagination oread insisted. she had to have seen them. that however wasnt the discovery. sister was drawing something very rapidly one day and she forgot that someone with very rapid eyes might be watching her hands. oread saw and she waited around after class. you are a funnyfingers she said to sister. all your fingers are triple jointed like mine. they can move fast as light like mine. i bet you can pick up iron parts out of the hot pots without getting burned. sure i can said sister m.d. but are you a funnyfingers all the way oread asked. papa says that in the old language our name funnyfingers meant both funnyfingers and funnytoes. are you sure i am said the very younglooking sister mary dactyl. she took off her shoes and stockings. sisters didnt do that very often in the classroom then. now of course they go everywhere barefooted and in nothing but a transparent short shift but that wasnt so when oread funnyfingers was still in the eighth grade. yes sister was a funnytoes also. she had the triplejointed fastasvision toes. she could do more things with her toes than other people could do with their fingers. did you have a little hill or mountain when you were young i mean when you were a girl oread asked her. oh yes yes i have it still an interior mountain. how old are you sister who always looks so young and pretty very old oread very old.  how old ask me again in eight years oread if you still want to know. in eight years oh all right i will. high school went by four years just like a day. selim had made a big twisted hammered iron thing that said selim loves oread. he suspected something very strongly about the iron. but he wasnt a funnyfingers so it took him three weeks instead of three seconds to make the thing. many other things happened in those four years but they were all happy things so there is no use mentioning them. when they were in and almost through college oread still looked like a nine or tenyearold and this was maddening they were into some very intricate courses. selim was veritable genius and oread always knew in which pots the answers might be found so the two of them qualified for the profound fields. it is good to have a piece of the deep raw knowledge as it births it is good to see the future lifted out of the future pots. we have come to the point where we must invent a whole new system of concepts and symbols said the instructor of one powerful course one day. little girl what are you doing in this room he added to oread. this is a college building and a college course. i know it. weve been through this every day for a year she said. we are as much at a crossroads as was mankind when the concept of a crossroads was first invented the instructor continued. if that concept excluding choice pictured graphically with simple diverging lines had not been invented mankind would have remained at that situation unchoosing and merely accepting. there are dozens of cases where mankind has remained in a particular situation for thousands of years for failure to invent a particular concept. i suspect that is the situation here we have not moved in a i certain area because we have not entertained the possibility of movement in that area. a whole new concept is needed but i cannot even conceive what that concept should be. oh ill make it for you tonight oread said. has that little girl wandered into the class again today the instructor asked with new irritation. oh yes i remember now you always come up with some sort of proof that youre an enrolled member of the class and that youre twentyone years old. youre not though. youre just a little girl with littlegirl brains. oh i know it oread said sadly but ill still make the thing for you tonight. make what thing little girl the new concept and the symbol set that goes with it. and just what does one make a concept out of that man asked her with near exasperation. ill make it mostly out of iron i think oread said. ill use whatever is in the pots but i guess it will be mostly iron. oh god help us the man cried out. such a nice expression oread told him and somebody had told me that you were an unbeliever.    actually said the instructor controlling himself and talking to the rest of the class and not to oread funnyfingers. actually these things often appear simple in retrospect. so may this be if ever we are able to make it retro. the abcs the alphabet isnt very hard is it yes mr. levkovitch i know all about those hard letters after c. a little humor it is said is a tedious thing. but the alphabet was a hard thing when mankind stood at the foothills en daktulos at the toes of thats what the original form of the expression   was oread told him. be quiet little girl the instructor muttered darkly. when mankind stood at the foothills of the alphabetical concept and looked up at the mountain it was hard then. yes the first alphabets were all made out of hammered iron oread told the world and they were quite hard. the same was the case with simple arithmetic said the instructor disregarding oread with a deep sigh. it is easy as we look back on it in its ordered simplicity. but when it was only a crying need and not yet a real concept then it was hard very hard. sure it was made out of iron too oread whispered to selim. why does he get so mad when i tell him about things being made out of iron its just a weakness of the man oread selim whispered. well have to accept it. and so we are probably at an end the instructor was ending his class for the day. if we cannot come up with a new dimension with a symbolism with a new thought and a new concept having no idea at all what they should be then we might as well end this class forever. we might as well as a matter of likely fact end the world forever. and on that somber note i leave you till tomorrow if there should be a tomorrow. dont worry mr. zhelezovitch oread said. ill make it for you tonight. new 2. the name daktuloi fingers is variously explained from their number being five or ten or because they dwelt at the foot en daktulois of mount ida. the original number seems to have been three i.e. kelmis the smelter damnameneus the hammer and acmon the anvil. this number was afterward increased to five then to ten ... and finally to one hundred. harpers dictionary of classical literature and antiquities in the forests of phrygian ida there lived cunning magicians called the dactyls. originally there were three of them. celmis damnameneus and the powerful acmon who in the caves of the mountains was the first to practice the art of hephaestus and who just after closing time that evening oread funnyfingers went by city museum to see selim. selim elia worked as night watchman there to help pay his way through the university. there really wasnt much to do on the job. he sat at a big administrators desk and studied all night. studying all night every night is how he got to be a genius. oread had brought some sandwiches with her. peanutbutter and jelly sandwiches made out of iron selim joked. no theyre not of iron oread said solemnly. one would need iron teeth to eat an iron sandwich. surely a funnyfingers could manage iron teeth. oh our third set comes in iron but for me that should be many years yet. oread i want to marry you. everyone calls you a cradlerobber. i know they do. and yet were almost exactly the same age. theres so many people here oread said. terra cotta people marble people sandstone people basalt people raffia people wooden people wax people. i will have to find out from my uncles which ones are real. some of them arent you know some of them never lived at all. we have one of your friends or uncles here oread in wax. over here. i know where. you have all three of my uncles here in wax oread said. you might not recognize them from the forms of their names on the plaques though. oh kelmis oh acmon oh damnae all three knew how to work blue iron casting it into the burning furnace. later their number increased. from phrygia they went to crete where they taught the inhabitants the use of iron and how to work metals. to them is also attributed the discovery of arithmetic and the letters of the alphabet. larousse encyclopedia of mythology it is also said of the dactyls the fingerfolk inside the hills that they live very long lives and retain their youthful appearance for very many years. groff crocker meardaoine come out of your cases and play with me. i dont think theyll come out though selim since theyre made out of wax instead of iron. effigies should always be made out of iron. what do their names mean oread oh smelter oh anvil oh hammer all three come out of your cases and play with me. no they wont come out. id have to be a beebrain to evoke anything out of wax. oread i love you very much. no they wont come out at all. ill have them come over here themselves some night and make iron effigies of themselves. then you can get rid of those silly wax ones. little ironears i said that i loved you very much. oh i heard you. you wont be alarmed when they come out some night to make the effigies theyre kind of funnylooking. so are you oread. no i wont be alarmed. why should a syrian be alarmed over fabulous people were fabulous people ourselves. and if theyre your uncles they cannot be dangerous. sure they can. i am. you said yourself that id set the flaming ducks after you again. i go home now selim to get my homework made and also to make that conceptsymbol system for mr. zhelezovitch the instructor. its important isnt it ill go with you oread. yes its important to zhelly and to the class and the course. its true that he might as well end the class forever if he doesnt find it. but it isnt true that we might as well end the world if we dont find it. its not quite that important. who will watch the museum if you leave i want very much to make this correctly and understandably for mr. zhelezovitch. i am a funnyfinger and making things for people is the whole business and being of the funnyfingers. oh tell kelmis to watch the place for me. will it take long for them and you to make the concept oh watch it for selim and watch it real nice oh kelmis from rotters and robbers and mice. sure hell watch it for you. even a waxmankelmis will be faithful in that. oh no they never take very long to make anything for anybody any more. time had slipped by though not much of it selim had a sporty car that he drove like a flaming rocket and it wasnt very far to the northwest side of town. they were out at the funnyfingers place now and into the back back rooms that turned into tunnels. they never take very long to make things anymore oread was continuing not since that time you know when god got a little bit testy with them on sinai when there was a little delay. they first made the tablets out of iron entirely and they wouldnt do. they had to make them out of slatestone with the iron letters inset in it and the iron had to be that alloy known as command iron. since then they are all pretty prompt with everyone and they follow instructions exactly. you never know who it really is who places an order. kelmis has the original alliron set. ill get him to show them to you some time. where do you get your stories oread i tell my mother that i make them out of iron. and where do you really get them i make them out of iron.  selim talked easily with the three uncles while they wrought and hammered the whitehot parts that oread was to assemble into a symbol concept. how is it that you work inside a little hill in oklahoma he asked them. shouldnt you be in the forests or hills of phrygian ida how did you come to leave the old country this is the old country and we havent left it powerful acmon said. everything underground anywhere is part of the old country. all hills and mountains of the world connect down in their roots in their toes and they make a single place. we are in mount ida we are in crete we are in oklahoma. it is all one. they made the pieces. and oread dipping the parts out of the whitehot iron as if it were water put them together to make the thing. it was a new conceptsymbol system and it looked as if it would work. and it looked much more as if it would work the next afternoon. mr. zhelezovitch the instructor was almost out of his mind with it. the graduate students and the regular students for this was one of those advanced mixed classes crowded about it and went wild. the implications of the new thing would tumble in their minds for weeks the class would be a marathon affair going on and on as the wonderful new things were put to work to uncover still more wonderful things. the stars were out when oread and selim left the class and no one else would leave it at all that night. but these two had something between them and it might take another new concept to solve it. oread give me your answer selim was saying again. i want to marry you. make a wish on a star then. on that one where im pointing. triple jointed funnyfingers who can tell where youre pointing on that male star there between the several eunuch stars. yes i see the one you mean oread. i make a wish. now when will you answer me within a half hour. i go to question two people first. i oread left there at a run. she went home. she talked to her mother. mama why is my father so boyish is he really just a boy yes he is oread. just a boy. after some years would he be a man really and not just a pleasant young kid i think so oread yes. then after some years you two could have children of your own being a funnyfingers isnt an obstacle ill never know that oread. when he is grown up i will be long dead. oread ran out of there and ran to the convent that was behind the school she used to attend. she entered and went upstairs and down a hallway. she knew where she was going. one funnyfingers can always find another one. besides the eight years was up. she opened the door and found sister mary dactyl playing solitaire with iron cards. how old oread asked. three hundred and fiftyeight years said sister m.d. without looking up. were i not vowed i would be coming to the family age now. oread ran all the way back to where selim was still waiting in the street under the stars. she was crying she was bawling. the answer is no she blubbered. selim under the stars was as white faced as it is possible for a syrian to be. but he must not give up. oread i love you more than you can know he said. maybe we can make a different answer out of iron he proposed in desperate jest. this is the iron answer she bawled and the answer is no. she ran away too fast to follow. deep under the hills oread was crying. she was weeping big hot tears. they werent however iron tears that she wept. that part is untrue. the tears were actually of that aromatic flux of salt and rosin that wroughtiron workers employ in their process. . thieving bear planet introduction by jeff vandermeer anomalies are messy r. a. lafferty writes at the beginning of thieving bear planet and the reader might be forgiven for thinking lafferty was referring to his own career and body of work. but in fact hes referring to the alien thieving bears of the title which follow their own peculiar set of rules. too often science fiction gives us humans in uncanny bear suits so to speak when it comes to aliens. but lafferty in this story and several others manages to create deeply strange and original alien encounters that both unsettle the reader and send up traditional science fiction approaches. as ever with lafferty too he manages feats of compression that are beyond most writers. take the deliberately blithe reference to a directory and delineation of planets which in offering an entry on the thieving bear planet tries from the start to impose a cage of logic on the unknowable with its catalog of the usual planetary attributes even if it destabilizes its authority in the same instant by including irrational statements from a former explorer of the planet. or take laffertys riotous description of the current expeditions gastronomes delight of a mealwhich proves to be a great set up to the stealing of the thieving bears who are not just robbing the explorers very stomachs of plain old porkandbeans but a sumptuous feast that the reader may feel the loss quite viscerally. these are lovely stories within the main story little whirlpools of magnificent narrative energy. visceral is a key word when thinking of laffertys triumphs alongside weird. in again a condensed talelike form lafferty accomplishes what some space operas take trilogies to get to. a space opera in its finest form is just a mimic a commercial delivery system for some of the strangest moments and situations in science fiction. see early alastair reynolds for example. with lafferty the traditional tropes of sfalien contact alien invasion the noble exploration of spaceare jewels he likes to put beneath tattered overturned cups daring the reader to bet on where in the world the true treasure lies. but bewarewhen you pin down the location of that treasure itll likely change shape grow legs and hop off the table. this applies even to the thieving bears of the title who take on a marvelous initial form able to fly not so much because of having lightweight bones but because theyre almost like drifting toupees in structure. the mimicry they are capable of seems cute at first and then horribly brutal as the explorers become caught up in events they cannot control. yet even then lafferty isnt content restless. it would have been easy enough for him to take the initial setup to a very satisfying conclusion but instead he roughs up and destabilizes his own story with the second act which makes the reader question ... well everything. is all that occurs just a joke by the thieving bears is there some other animating impulse at work how is it that this jengalike structure lafferty creates doesnt fall and crash to the ground along with many other complexities then thieving bear planet chronicles the impossibility of comprehension of the alien the war between the logical and illogical in ourselves that spills out into the cosmos beyond all in the context of the certain knowledge that human beings will never know everything about this world let alone the next or the universes we inhabit. and that there is something wonderful about that fact. not many writers could grapple with such ideas and create a story thats both so creepy and so funny and in the moment but as in laffertys best work in general the author manages to channel a narrative momentum and a kind of joy in the very act of outrageous and madcap invention that provides unity depth and yes even a kind of beautiful closure. thieving bear planet deliver me from carks and cares deliver me from thieving bears. john chancel logs and epilogs of sector 24 a simple explanation was needed for the conditions on thieving bear planet. it was needed because as the great reginald hot had phrased it anomalies are messy. every decade or so somebody with a passion for regularity takes over the administration of the directory and delineation of planets that massive cataloging operation and makes a new survey of the anomalies. and there was not any way that such a survey could miss thieving bear planet. it offers no threat to human life or activity no danger to bodily health and only slight danger to mental health the great john chancel had written about it a century before this. it has almost uniformly ideal climate though it is not a place to generate sudden wealth. it is serene in environment and in ecological balance and it is absolutely caressing in its natural beauty. but it does have a strange effect on some of its visitors. it forces them to write things that are untrue as it is forcing me to do at this moment. that was an odd thing to write in a ships log. and as one later old hand put it there is nothing to conquer here. it is a poorly endowed and counterproductive world. and everything goes wrong here. i will say this for it things go wrong here in the most pleasant way possible. but they do go wrong. now another expedition consisting of six explorersgeorge mahoon he was wrestlerbig and with a groping grappling leverageseeking wrestler mind elton fad he was long on information and short on personal incandescence benedict crixcrannon buff and charming and he knew all the jobs of the expedition luke fronsa he was a comer as they said in the department but wasnt he a little bit overage in grade as a comer now selma lastrose what can you say after you say that somebody has everything gladys marclair pleasant capable but she wasnt a genius and genius was really required for an explorer and dixie latelark sheer spirit shehad set down on thieving bear planet. these were not the most experienced explorers in the service but they were among the newest and freshest. and they had already demonstrated that they were top people at clearing up anomalies. its a pleasant place but not good for much george mahoon said before they had been there ten minutes. why didnt the earlier explorers simply say that it was only marginally or submarginally productive indicated by fast scans to be poor in both radioactive and base metals and also in rare earths and fossil fuels not recommended for development in the present century when so many better places are available or some such thing as that why did they put so much stuttering gibberish in their reports im going to like it here though. its nice for a brief vacation. oh im going to like it too selma lastrose spoke in her curious rata tattat voice. there must be a puzzle here and i like puzzles. and theres a minor mystery in this plain of the old spaceships. i may as well solve that. they had landed in a clear place on the plain of the old spaceships. here there were remarkable fullscale drawings or schematics of old spaceships twelve of them in twothirds of a circle from the earliest to the latest going clockwise on the ground. what medium these schematics were done in was not certain but the lush grass refrained from growing on the lines of them and so marked them off. the drawings showed the circlespheres of the spaceships and their fore and aft bulges. they gave accurate indication of the interior bulkheads. this was really a lifesized museum of ships that lacked only substance and the dimension of height. i recall two passages in the log of the ship sorcerer about this plain or meadow elton fad said. the first of them stated some of our party believe that the plain of the ships was actually done by the thieving bears in a historical marker sort of response but i myself do not credit the little a beasties with that much intelligence. and there was a later entry in another hand the thieving bears really did make those schematicsinthegrass memorials of all the spaceships that had been here but they didnt do it in any way that we had imagined. but that latter log entry like latter entries of several of the explorers had been written in something other than ink. well ill imagine a few ways that the little buggers could have done it and ill test it somehow. ill ask them how they did it. if the tittering little obscenities have any intelligence at all ill find a way to ask them. the tittering little obscenities the thieving bears were not much like bears. they were more like large flying squirrels and they did glide on the winds apparently for sport. they were more like pack rats the neotoma cinerea of earth both in appearance and in their thieving ways but larger. it was old john chancel who had named the species ursus furtificus the thieving bears. oh the explorers had their introduction to the thieving of the little animals within five minutes of planetlanding. the creatures came into the ship itself and got into places that should have been impossible to them. they stole selmas candy and dixies snuff. they stole by drinking it on the spot george mahoons heman scentcinnamon thirteen bottles of it but they did not drink any of the other scents. they went wild over mustard emptying whole containers of it and then wheezing in delicious agony from the effect. elton fad tried to drive them away with heavy sticks. they fastened onto the sticks while he swung them and ate them right up to his hands. they were funny but they could become infuriating. they stole six of dixie latelarks french horror story novels. that wouldnt be fatal to her. she had lots of them. theyre going to sample them dixie said. she herself looked a little bit like one of those thieving bears. theyll be the test. if they do read them and appreciate them itll prove that theyre intelligent creatures and have better reading tastes than my crewmates. that will be a start in analyzing them something to put into the electronic notebooks. could the thieving bears talk that was not determined for sure within the first ten or even twenty minutes. say good morning fuzzy head selma rattled at one of the creatures. say good morning fuzzy head it bearbarked back at her. well it had the right number of syllables and the right rhythm and stress. and the bear barks did resemble selmas rattling words. and whenever the bears answered one of the persons it answered in that persons own timbre. the bears began to imitate the people quickly and there was never any doubt as to which person was being imitated. the tittering that went with the imitations though ooooh that could become tiresome after a little while. tittering little obscenities yes. could the thieving bears read twould be known in a bit maybe. the bears had gotten into those big lockers that were full of comic books and had stolen big bunches of them. these comic books from the trader planets were now collectors items on old earth and they generated quite a profit. the wonderful things should be collectors items everywhere. some of the big thieving bears were reading those comic books to some of the little thieving bears reading them in the thieving bears own barking talk. and some of the little bears would bark their excitement and incredulity at parts of the narration and would come and look at the pictures and the worded balloons themselves. and then there would be that damned tittering it was clear that the big bears believed that they were reading and that the little bears believed they were understanding. but the wording in the comic book balloons was in the gnopidgin dialect of the trader planets and people from the traders had never been to thieving bear planet. it was almost too much to believe that sangsters syndrome intuitive translation was being practiced by animals below the level of conceptual thinking. then some of the little bears were clearly acting out episodes from the comic books very subtle episodes according to benedict crixcrannon who had total knowledge of the content of all the comic books from the lockers. well there was no easy explanation for that. the explorers treated themselves to a bonus meal within an hour of their arrival after things were pretty well settled down. on a new world they did this only when they had complete confidence that everything was under control. it was a traditional earthhearty meal though it was from a packet of such bonus meals that had been packaged on trader planet number four. there were tencentimeterthick cape buffalo steaks mountains of midland mushrooms camiroi currants and astrobe apples elton eels wrack world rye bread galaxy brand goat butter rain mountain coffee rumboat cordials and ganymede cigars they have an aroma that outlasts the everlasting hills a testimonial said of those perfectos. logs of earlier explorers say that there is no real enjoyment in eating on thieving bear planet because of the harassment of the bears benny crix crannon gloated. well im enjoying this meal another bumper of rumboat cordial luke please and id like to see anybody take that enjoyment away from me. and yet the enjoyment and savor of that grand meal began to disappear almost at that moment. how oh it was just that all the items of their enjoyment were being mysteriously stolen away from them. all the rest of dixies snuff has been stolen by the bears now gladys said. thats too bad. she loves it so much. if all her idiosyncrasies are stolen away its as if she is stolen away too. and another thirty or so of dixies french horror story novels have been stolen by the bears elton fad grumbled. shes bound to be frustrated by that. we should insist on fair play from the bears. her gold snuffboxes have been stolen too selma lastrose lamented. how mean of the bears the snuffboxes were valuable even for the gold. and her hookah pipe is gone luke fronsa complained. what will the bears steal next i dont know george mahoon wondered but dixie latelark has herself been stolen now or at least shes gone. she could not have gone out unrecorded for the ship is on full security. and yet the ship itself registers that she is no longer on board. she was sitting between you and selma was she not gladys she was yes just a moment ago on the chair between the two of us. but there isnt any chair between us now and there couldnt have been there isnt any room for one. she must have been sitting on something else. oh that damned tittering i wonder how they stole her and what they did with her. be rational gladys luke said. theres no way the little bears could have stolen dixie latelark. then where did she go and how i dont know mahoon admitted and i dont believe that any of us know. all at once it doesnt seem very important. ah im queasy. yes and im hungry. after a perfect bonus meal i shouldnt be either. fortunately i had plugged myself into the ships monitor because of early reports of anomalies on thieving bear planet reports of the wellfeeling and the wits of the explorers being stolen away. all right monitor what has gone wrong with me the ships monitor spilled it all out. it was in coded chatter. but we all understand the coded chatter just like our mothers milk as dixie had once said. all of them were completely tuned to the code of their own ship. and each of them put it into words automatically. essential food value suddenly stolen from your ingested food the monitor chattered. pepsin stolen from your stomach thalmatite stolen from your thalamus thyroxine stolen from your pharynx cape buffalo essence stolen from your esophagus and stomach mushrooms and currants and apples stolen from your lower stomach and small intestine rum alcohol stolen from your stomach and ileum and bloodstream and normal blood alcohol and blood sugar stolen as part of the same theft. slurry of rye bread and butter and coffee stolen from your paunch and antrum stomach. essence of elton eels stolen from some saltwater swamp of you. and at the same time insulin and glucagon are stolen from your pancreas hepatocytes and bile salts from your bile duct and duodenum and words ideas and inklings have been swiped from several parts of your brain. no wonder youre queasy and hungry at the same time. thank you ships monitor george mahoon said. well it seems that ive been infected by some microbe or germ or virus. ill take a few of the antianti pills to quell the infection. forget the antianti pills george elton fad cried angrily. i think we should take a couple of steel bars and teach the thieving bears a lesson. there are microbes and germs and viruses infecting me too but they are about half my own size and are known as the thieving bears. damn those tittering little idiots theyre beginning to intrude too intimately with their thefts and their eatings but i dont know how theyre doing these things so interiorly. sometimes i wish id gone into the family business and never become an explorer at all. elton fads family was in eels they were big and rich people in eels. a little doll made out of wax and rags with thorns and pins and needles sticking clear through it and with its throat cut horribly came sailing through the air and landed on the table where all the explorers had just finished their fine meal that had lost its power just after passing its climax. the tortured little doll had dixie latelarks face on it. its mouth was wide open and it was screaming silently and horribly. at least we know that the bears can read and absorb worldfrench gladys marclair laughed. and they all laughed. they couldnt have learned about the poupéesfetiches the fetish dolls anywhere except from dixies french horror stories. why its stridente mimi screaming mimi herself. thats really dixies theme story. oh i wish that dixie would come back so she could see this comical takeoff of herself. shut your mouth dolldixie gladys pushed her forefinger against the mouth of the little fetish doll to close it but the doll bit her finger suddenly viciously terribly and set the blood gushing from it. when gladys got her finger loose again the doll opened its mouth wide once more and continued to scream silently and horribly from a now blooddribbling mouth. it has long been noted that fetish dolls seem to have a life of their own. that little comic interlude cheered them all a bit and they left the table in a happier state. and they went out from the ship. oh the thieving bears wanted to play games did they well the explorers would beat them at their games and they would solve all the mysteries about them at the same time. but the explorers had now come to regard the bears as more complex and as more nearly intelligent than they had previously seemed. they were still tittering little stinkers though. the thieving bears were bigger than police dogs and a little bit smaller than great danes. they were toothless and clawless and apparently harmless. how can you worry about such tittering and giggling things a quick come quick selma lastrose was calling in a queer voice on the edge of panic. come quick ive found dixie. the thieving bears however large they seemed gave the impression of being nearly weightless. they had to be nearly weightless to glide on the wind the way they did. they seemed to be mostlywell it wasnt hair and it wasnt feathersthey seemed to be mostly made out of a fluffy and deep piled covering with not much body inside it. come come somebody come selma was still calling in her rattling voice. dixie is dead. the bears had to be ninety percent fluffy covering and no more than ten percent body. otherwise big as they seemed they couldnt have gotten through some of the holes that they did go through. horribly horribly dead selma was chanting in a littlegirl singsong voice. horribly horribly dead. oh please somebody come and help me look at her. i can hardly manage to look at her all by myself. dead dixie latelark was an exact lifesized replica of her own many timestransfixed fetish doll. her throat was just as flamboyantly and terribly cut as the dolls had been. the same thorns and pins and needles ran through her but now they were meterlong thorns and twometerlong needles. and her mouth was very wide open as had been that of the doll and dixie was likewise screaming horribly and silently. and a tittering a giggling in the thieving bears fashion was coming from her silently screaming mouth and also from her laidopen throat. how ghastly the horror was broken a bit or diverted into a wondering exasperation by benny crixcrannons voice booming heres another one of them. this ones better done. its good yes it was another horribly dead dixie latelark with her throat cut even more savagely with her poor body transfixed with even longer thorns and needles with the tittering and giggling from her wideopen and silently screaming mouth even more disconcerting. in all they found seven lifesized versions of dixie latelark horribly and ritually murdered. then all seven of them jumped up turned into rather young thieving bears and ran away tittering. and the very stones of that planet seemed to join in that tittering and giggling. but where was dixie latelark herself was that not a pertinent question more pertinent questions may have been why did all the explorers stop wondering what had happened to their colleague dixie latelark and why did they now feel that her disappearance was unimportant  i have lost my judgment george mahoon lamented. ive still got most of the pieces of things in my mind but i can no longer put them together. putting things together is what judgment is. one of you others will have to take over the captaincy of this expedition. oh bother the captaincy gladys marclair rejected it. expeditions would be better without captains anyhow. and you cant lose something that you never had george. lets play ask the question with this situation. and lets wonder why no bunch coming here has played it before. this is an earthsized planet and remarkably monotonous. on its lookalike continents there are hundreds and thousands of little low plains or meadows comparable to this plain of the old spaceships. why have all the expeditions to this world from that of john chancel to our own landed here within one thousand meters of each other instructions for exploration landing sites have always been random selection tempered with intelligence. and another instruction has been examine new ground wherever possible. for whose convenience have we all landed in this one place oh your diminished judgment george probably somebody has been eating the hippo out of your hippocampus ive always believed that the little hype is the center of the judgment as well as of the memory so now youre not as well hyped as you were. what if hardly any of the area of this planet has been checked out oh we made sixteen scanning circuits of thieving bear planet before we landed george mahoon said. sixteen circuits will give a very good recorded sample. and some of the previous expeditions made the full sixty four scanning circuits and the full scan doesnt miss much. do we believe that the thieving bears are to be found in all parts of this planet george selma lastrose asked. i dont know. do we believe it benny oh no. the thieving bears are strictly smallspecies and smallarea creatures. their crankinesses as well as their brilliancies indicate that they have far too small a genepool. they have to stay close together in a small area to keep warm in the special of a species identitysurvival sense. as to myself ive lost more than my judgment luke fronsa mourned. ive lost all my ideas and all that i have left now are notions. somebody is eating all my ideas right out of my head and leaving only the hulls of them. did you know that notions are only the shells or hulls of ideas after the meat is eaten out of them the bears were toothless and they were playful. sometimes they came gliding in on the air and they might be practically invisible when the light was in their favor. they came gliding in or ambling in and they tagged the people gently as a breath. but whenever they touched the people however briefly or lightly they left what seemed to be very small entering marks. and they also left a redness like the stings of nettles. one of the explorers no matter which one they had begun to run together even in their own regard said that the thieving bears were really a species of giant insects insects with strange appetites and always hungry.  seven days and nights went by very rapidly. it was a giddy world in this respect fastspinning for seven days and nights on thieving bear planet were the equivalent of only about eighteen hours on old earth or sixteen hours on astrobe. and the fastspin did make a difference on thieving bear. it was because of the fastspin that there were no large treelike plants not even any very large bushes. there were small bushes and there was the non gramineous grass. a 2. people without an accompaniment of ghosts are a deprived people. they will descend to almost any depth of oriental cultishness or modish superstition or silliness or astrological depravity to hide the fact that they have lost their ghosts. ghosts without an accompaniment or neighborness of people are similarly deprived and they will cast themselves into the most bizarre roles or forms to try to create a company for themselves. both of these conditions are unhealthy. terrance taibhse introduction to ghost stories of sector 24 the storminess of thieving bear planet wouldnt have permitted any botanical constructs taller than small bushes. and the fastspin of thieving bear compelled certain surface conditions for that world. on most worlds the hills go up. on thieving bear planet the hills went down. the upper levels of all the continents of thieving bear were flat and lush and sometimes they were swept by violent winds. and down from them the hills ran to the sheltered plains or meadows or circlevalleys such as was the plain of the old spaceships and on these lower levels the winds were less violent. two of the seven short nights just past had been electric nights and the ghosts walked on electric nights. the electric nights were highlighted literally by massive thunderstorms and plasmal displays. the odds are that these storms are more violent than the storms where you come from. the lightning piled up on the high places roaring like lazaruslions. then it rolled down the hills like waterfalls and formed hot and spitting pools on the lower plains and meadows. the ghosts were always there but some of them were ordinarily like empty balloons. on the electric nights they filled up with lightning and manifested themselves. but others of the ghosts were always lowkey living out their endless nights and days till they would finally fade away after a long era. one of the ghosts was that of john chancel one of the earlier visitors to thieving bear planet usually called the discoverer of thieving bear but now he said that this wasnt true. during the second of the electric nights chancels ghost sat in the cockpit room of the ship with the explorers and lovingly handled the eight hundred knobs wheels levers push buttons keyboards and voice boxes that commanded the ship. the ships hadnt been so sophisticated in his day. i catch onto all the new and enjoyable advances in ship control quicker than he would chancels ghost spoke softly. oh he has the physical brains with him most of them but i have the intuition. and he we were never very good on brains anyhow. we had the mystique and the personality we had the intuition we guessed a lot and we faked a lot. but we were never a welllinked personality. just how does one become a ghost gladys marclair asked. besides dying i mean is there any way to bring it about it happens in many cases long before death. i was his ghost here for twenty years earth years before chancel died elsewhere. he left his my  a ghost here on his second landing. he came back here for me several times after that but i wouldnt rejoin him or go away with him. he had become quite cranky in his ways and i in mine. there would have been everlasting conflict if we had joined. but it was also psychic disaster more for him than for me for us to be separated. its not at all rare for a living person to be separated from his ghost. i see that two of you six have become separated from your own ghosts and none of you can guess which two of you it is. on thieving bear the conditions seem to be favorable for these splitups. it leaves a great hunger yes a physical hunger in the ghosts who are left behind. but each planet has its own ghostliness that is different from that of other places. even old earth has remnants and tatters of ghostliness and it isnt a hungry world. as a prophet said happy the world that has iron meadows and rich essences on which the spirits may feed and then go to sleep. but we spirits are most often sleepless here. what happened to dixie latelark gladys marclair asked this pleasant ghost. oh shes a ghost of a different sort. there never was any dixie late lark as a person. there were only the six of you who arrived here. dixie was your esprit de group your group effigy and also a manifestation of your goofiness syndrome. but we made her visible to you for the first time. and you recognized her and accepted her in your unthinking way. this unthinking way has become part of the environment of thieving bear planet. she was the toothsome imaginative essence of all of you the capriciousness or coltishness of you and that made her very appetizing. we love essence. its so concentrated. why did you make her visible selma asked. because we like to see what were eating. who or what are the thieving bears luke fronsa asked chancels ghost. oh theyre a sort of tumbleweed a sort of nettle. ghosts use them to get around in some of the time so i myself am often a thieving bear. it is only on the electric nights that we can inflate ourselves with enough plasm to look like ourselves. we walk here a lot because we are always hungry and restless. ghosts in places that are richer in organics and metals and minerals stay well fed by a sort of osmosis so they walk and stir very little. they sleep their  decades and centuries away. notice it sometimes that active ghosts are only to be found in deprived regions. one of my counterparts has hardly stirred in a hundred years. i can feel my counterparts but theres not much of them to feel. where do the little thieving bears come from from a very early landing perhaps the earliest for they were here when i arrived. it was an illadvised settlement expedition of men women and children. then all died of starvation not knowing how to turn the lush grass into food. they were the first of the hungry ghosts. it was their crying hunger that has drawn all the ships to land in this one place. come let us eat you is their cry and it is still a most passionate cry. you spoke of your counterparts a moment ago george mahoon said. did john chancel generate more ghosts than one is he himself restless and hungry oh i myself the central john chancel have gone to my glory. but all of us great ones leave multiple ghosts behind us. he i left at least two others besides myself. we have a sort of awareness of each other a loose feeling. he had real greatness unlikely as it seems and i didnt. and yet this is the paradox he saw himself entirely from the outside and he loved what he saw i saw us from the inside and i wasnt impressed. and we were not the first man on as many planets as is claimed for us. we were not the first man here. there were already thieving bears here when we came ghosts of earlier explorers. but john chancel had the greatness and the earlier explorers had it not. so chancel was credited with many first landings. good luck to you ladies and gentlemen when you lift off in your capsule this electric morning. there are several entries that you must make in your log immediately after liftoff or you will forget them and never make them at all. and you will have to make these entries in something other than ink. why should we lift off in our capsule elton fad asked. we use the capsule only when the ship is inoperative. its inoperative now and forever the ghost of john chancel said. well its a good ship and it eased the hunger of a lot of us. youd better lift off in a the capsule as soon as possible now. we try to play fair but well be feeding on it very soon if its still here. that john chancel was a nice fellow even in his fading ghost form.     but a much more violent ghost right at that electric dawn after the second electric night was the ghost of manbreaker crag. after the second of the electric nights had ended manbreaker decided to remain apparent out of sheer stubbornness. they had all been feeling the powerful presence of this manbreaker crag for some time. im the only one here of any moment or weight manbreakers ghost spoke in a rough sort of roar. im not a person to crawl into pieces of nettle or tumbleweed or any weeds except my own mortal weeds. im not one to take on the form of a cutie giggling bear or other toy. i am not a ghost nor any part of a ghost story. ghost stories are for children and cutie bears. i am a simple dead man who is restless and hungry on this mineralpoor world. on electric nights i go get my own body where i keep it. i enter it and i inflate it with the crackling lightning and the electricity that has gathered here. im a hungry dead man with a dead mans temper. dont mess with me dont mess with us fellow george mahoon spoke sharply. our ship seems to be in a very weakened condition and we have to be getting out of here quickly. stay out of the way graverot oaf and be quiet. elton go sharpen this and then bring it back to me along with a heavy sledgehammer. i think i know how to deal with hungry dead men. george mahoon handed a thick and heavy hardwood dowel pin to elton fad. it was about the length and heft of a baseball bat. the other ones the real ghosts which is to say the real unreal ones have their little selfsaving fables that they recite when they feed on people and the possessions of people the hungry longdead man manbreaker crag roared. the only speaking voice he possessed was this sort of dogged roar. they say we do not steal important things out of your minds. we steal only funnyshaped trifling things. serious people like you are better off without them. our gain is your gain. that is what they are telling you but they lie. what we eat out of your minds are the most serious things that your minds are capable of holding. what we steal and eat out of your bodies are the tastiest things in your bodies. we come to table on you and we feast on you. what we eat out of your ships and your stores are the most nourishing and sophisticated things you have brought wotto metal data gelatin electronic reta codified memories and processes. we eat these things because we are hungry. and i eat them more ravenously than do any of the others. i eat the essence of minds and leave gibbering idiocy in its place. i eat the bodies of whole people where they stand. is everything possible transferred from the ship to the capsule big george mahoon asked his party. it is several of them answered. i will eat the essence of your capsuleboat just as all of us on thieving bear have eaten the essence of your ship dead manbreaker crag roared. is it sharpened mahoon asked as he took the thick hardwood dowel from the returning elton fad. it is sharpened elton said but something has gone wrong with it. it loses weight as i stand here. they feed across short distances. scrawny ship captain i think ill eat you as you stand there dead manbreaker roared at captain mahoon. youd make a big bite but ill eat you. big george mahoon felled bigger deadman manbreaker crag with a powerful blow to his dead face. then he put the point of the sharpened dowel pin yes elton i believe that he ate the heart out of it but how could it have been prevented mahoon asked to the region of the heart of manbreaker and struck the pin a heavy blow with the big sledgehammer. but the wooden pin or stake came apart into weak splinters and pieces of wormeaten or zombieeaten wood. ah well well have to leave him as he is mahoon said. i dont know any other way to kill a man whos already dead. the six explorers got into the capsuleboat then and lifted off. they looked down on the ship they had left behind them then and it crumbled down and became a part of its own outline and schematic. it became one more of the token spaceships that formed that partcircle that gave the name plain of the old spaceships to that curious site. those drawn outlines of the old spaceships they were the old spaceships. there must have been a lot of good eating in each of them though. to the log george mahoon howled. i feel it all slipping out of my memory so fast each one of us take a long log page and write as rapidly as a possible. get it down before we lose it as earlier explorers lost it. no use lamenting that there is no ink in any stylus or pen or log pencil laid out or still boxed selma lastrose rattled. no use lamenting that even the electronic ink is eaten out of every recorder and that the remembering jelly is eaten out of every memory pot. the hungers of the thieving bears are unaccountable. all the earlier logs had a few words written in something other than ink. if we all write as fast as we can we may get more than a few words down. we may even get the explanation down onto the log sheets before it fades completely from our minds. they all opened their veins and wrote on the long log sheets in their own blood. it was sticky going. so many freeflowing things had been eaten out of their blood that it was now viscous and thick. but they made it do. they got the explanation all down even though when it was shown to them later they hardly remembered writing it. a simple explanation had been needed for the conditions on thieving bear planet. it was needed because as the great reginald hot had once phrased it anomalies are messy. and that simple explanation is herewith given more or less as it was written in thick blood in the log book. days of grass days of straw introduction by gary k. wolfe days of grass days of straw first appeared in new dimensions 3 the third in a series of rather adventurous anthologies edited by robert silverberg throughout the 1970s. coming close on the heels of science fictions controversial new wave silverbergs series was clearly out to recognize new voices and new literary approaches to science fiction and fantasy and lafferty had stories in each of the first four volumes. the volume with days of grass days of straw also included two stories which would become widely reprinted hugo awardwinning classics ursula k. le guins the ones who walk away from omelas and james tiptree jr.s the girl who was plugged in tiptree was of course later revealed to be a pseudonym of alice sheldon. each of those would be reprinted dozens of times in the coming decades but laffertys storydespite now being regarded as one of his best and most strikingly visionary by aficionados was reprinted only in a few of his own collections. it did however get translated into dutch and inspired the 2004 song dagen van gras dagen van stro a literal translation of the title by the performer spinvis erik de jong. spinviss lyrics have only an elliptical connection with laffertys story but the point is that laffertys best stories even when not widely familiar manage to find their way into unexpected corners of the culture and leave traces there. the story itself is one that some readers find challengingwithin the first two lines a city street morphs into a road then a trail then a mere path and  our protagonist christopher finds himself in a preurban preindustrial landscape with features resembling native american legends and oklahoma tall tales. even his own name doesnt ring true and halfrecognized people and places never quite coalesce into a more traditionally realized fantasy landscape. yet he feels revived and invigorated as though the world had been pumped full of new juice. things were mighty odd here he notices in an observation that may well sound familiar to anyone reading a lafferty story for the first time. there was just a little bit of something wrong about things. we eventually learn that christopher hasnt crossed into a fantasy world at all but rather to a different kind of timea day of grass one of the overflowing and special days apart from the regular days which are called days of straw. although these special days are days out of count in terms of history and the calendar they are earned at great cost by prophets and prayermen who wrestle with god to gain them. called by different names in different cultures these rich days full of joy and death bubbling with ecstasy and blood may include entire seasons and although nobody has direct memory of being in them or living in them we give them pallid names like indian summer. laffertys stunning vision of a more vital and perhaps more dangerous world just beyond the one we know but somehow folded into it is one of his most haunting recurrent themes. days of grass days of straw 1. fog in the corner and fog in his head gray day broken and bleeding red. henry drumhead ballads christopher foxx was walking down a city street. no it was a city road. it was really a city trail or path. he was walking in a fog but the fog wasnt in the air or the ambient it was in his head. things were mighty odd here. there was just a little bit of something wrong about things. oceans of grass for one instance. should a large and busy city and this was clearly that have bluegreen grass bellyhigh in its main street things hardly remembered echoes and shadows or were they the strong sounds and things themselves christopher felt as though his eyeballs had been cleaned with a magic cleaner as though he were blessed with new sensing in ears and nose as though he went with a restored body and was breathing a new sort of air. it was very pleasant but it was puzzling. how had the world been pumped full of new juice christopher couldnt recall what day it was he certainly didnt know what hour it was. it was a gray day but there was no dullness in that gray. it was shimmering pearlgray of a color bounced back by shimmering water and shimmering air. it was a crimsonedged day like a gray squirrel shot and bleeding redly from the inside and around the edges. yes there was the pleasant touch of death on things gushing death and gushing life. christophers own name didnt sound right to him. he didnt know what town he was in. indeed hed never before seen a town with all the storefronts flapping in the wind like that. ah theyd curl and bend but they wouldnt break. a town made of painted buckskin and yet it was more real than towns made of stone and concrete. he saw persons he almost knew. he started to speak and only sputtered. well hed get a newspaper then they sometimes gave information. he reached in his pocket for a coin and discovered that he didnt have regular pockets. he found a little leather pouch stuck in his belt. whats this what else was stuck in his belt it was a breechclout with the ends fore and aft passing under his belt. instead of pants he had a pair of leggings and a breechclout threepiece pants. oh oh what else oh he wore a shirt that seemed to be leather of some sort. he wore soft shoes that were softer than slippers. he was hatless and his hair came forward over his shoulders in two tight long braids. he had dressed casually before but he didnt remember ever dressing like this. how were the rest of the people dressed no two alike really no two alike. but he did bring a coin out of that leather pouch that was stuck in his belt. a strange coin. it wasnt metal it was made of stone and made roughly. on the face of it was the head and forequarters of a buffalo. on the reverse side was the rump of a buffalo. the words on the obverse of it read worth one buffalo and on the reverse they read maybe a little bit less. and where do i put a coin in this contraption christopher asked himself angrily and loudly. a hand extended itself and christopher put the coin in the hand. the hand belonged to an old wrinkled brown man swathed in robes and folds of blackened leather and sitting in the dust. the old man gave christopher a newspaper or gave him something anyhow. it was on leather that was almost boardstiff. it was illustrated it was printed in a variety of hands and here and there it had a little hair growing out of it as though its leather were imperfectly scraped. wait your change the old brown man said. he gave christopher seven small coins. these were neither metal nor stone they were clay baked in the sun. the obverse of each was the head and fore of a badger puffed and bristled and hissing in high defense. and the reverse was the reared rump of the same badger in embattled clawed stance. price go down a little but not a whole badger the old man said. take three puffs. its close as i can get to even change. wondering at himself christopher took three strong rich smoky puffs from the old pipe of the old man. he felt that he had received full value then. it was about all that he felt satisfied with. but is it wrong to feel unsatisfied which is unsated christopher thought about it. he went over and sat on a bale of rags outside the shop with the sign hot roast dog for sale or give. the bale of rags seemed somehow lively it was as if there was no division between the animate and the inanimate this day. he tried to make something out of the strange newspaper or the strange day or the newly strange man who was apparently himself. oh the newspaper was interesting. it could be read one way or another by picture by stylized pictograph by various writings and printings. here were anecdotes wooly horny bottomlessly funny anecdotes and they were about people that christopher knew or almost knew. and all the people passing by christopher realized it with a chuckling gasp were also people that he knew or almost knew. well what made them so different then they looked like familiar people they smelled like familiar people which the familiar people erstwhile had not done they had the familiar name that came almost to the edge of the tongue. but what town is this what day is this what is the context christopher wailed out loud. why is everything so strange kitfox you call me strange buffalo boomed at him. strange buffalo was a big and boisterous man and he had always been a good friend of christopher. he had then why did he look so different and why was his real name or his other name now unremembered will the buffalo go to war do you think kitfox strange buffalo asked him. do you believe that the two great herds of them will go to war they come near to each other now and they swear that neither will give way. no there will be only the pushing and goring of a few thousand bulls not much else christopher said. the buffalo simply havent the basis for a real war. he was surprised at his own knowledge of the subject. but the buffalo have human advisers now strange buffalo said. it began with the betting of course but now we can see that there is real cause a  a of conflict on both sides. i dabble in this myself and have some good ideas. we are tying spearshafts to the horns of some of the big bulls and teaching them to use them. and were setting up big bows and teaching them to bend them with their great strength but they havent any accuracy at all. no i dont believe they were meant to have a real war. its a wonderful dust they raise though when they all come together. it makes you glad to be alive. and the thunder of their millions of hoofs there was the distant sound of morning thunder. or is that a thundering in the mountains kit foxah christopher was asking. well there is quite a clatter in the mountains this morning kit strange buffalo was saying in happy admiration. the deep days the grass days like this one arent come by easily. its a wonder the mountains arent knocked to pieces when the big prophets pray so noisily and wrestle so strong. but as the good skin says we must work out our salvation in fear and thundering. is it not in fear and trembling christopher asked as he lounged on the lively bale of rags. no kitfox no strange buffalo pealed at him. thats the kind of thing they say during the straw days not here not now. in the cahooche shadowwriting it says in fear and chuckling but the cahooche words for thunder and chuckling are almost the same. on some of the kiowa antelope skin drawings in scareshaking and in laughtershaking. i like that. i wish i could pray and wrestle as wooly and horny as the big ones do. then id get to be a prophet on the mountain also and id bring in more days of grass. yes and days of mesquite also. the mountain is a funny one this morning strange buffalo. it doesnt reach clear down to the ground christopher said. theres a great space between and there are eagles flying underneath it. ah itll fall back after a while kitfox when they have won or lost the wrestling for the day after they have generated sufficient juice for this day for i see that they have already won it and it will be a day of grass. lets go have a rack of roast dog and a gourd of choc beer strange buffalo proposed. in a minute strange buffalo. i am in the middle of a puzzle and i have this fog in my head. what day is this its one of the days of grass kitfox. i just told you that. but which one strange buffalo and what really are days of grass i believe that it is the second monday of indian summer kitfox strange buffalo was saying as he gave the matter his thought and attention. or it may be the first monday of bluegoose autumn. were not sure though that it is a monday. it sounds and tastes more like a thursday or an aleikaday. it sure does christopherah kitfox agreed. a laughing dying man was carried past by four hale men. this fortunate one had been smashed by bear or rolled on by horse or gored by buffalo and the big red blood in him was all running out. it works the happy dying man cried out. it works. i got a little too close to him and he ripped me to pieces but it works. we are really teaching those big bulls to use the spears lashed to their horns. others will carry on the work and the fun. i bet that ive had it. a little blood to bless me strange buffalo cried out and the dying man splashed him with the rich and rigorous blood. for me also kitfox begged and the dying man smeared him with blood on the brow and breast and shoulders and loins. two other friends conquering sharpleaf and adoration on the mountain came and were blessed with the blood. then the man died and was dead. there is nothing like the fine rich blood to make a grass day sing in your head and in your body strange buffalo exulted. on the straw days they try to hide the blood or they bleed in a dark corner. what was all this about the grass days and the straw days there was now a sordid dulldream quality a dayofstraw quality that kept trying to push itself in. for a little while it begged to reestablish rigor and rule and reason for just a little while. go away said the dayofgrass quality. the wrestle was won this morning and this is a day out of the count. kitfox and strange buffalo went in past the booths and work areas of the coinmakers past the stands of the eaglewingbonewhistle makers and into the shop which had roast dog for sale or give. strange buffalo had a shoulder of dog and kitfox had a rack of ribs. there was fried bread also and hominy and pumpkin. there was choc beer dipped with gourd dippers out of a huge crock. thousands of people were there. it was crowded and it was supposed to be. the man named mountain twinkled in the air. why had a  a they not noticed that about him before folks rolled up the walls and tied them. now the strong smoke and savor could visit all the places and the folks in every shop could see into every other shop. it was full morning and beginning to get warm. but i still want to know the date kitfox insisted not quite converted to the day of grass not quite clear of the headfog that accompanies the sullen burning of the straw days. what newspaper is this that doesnt have a date i want a date look at it. it tells said strange buffalo. you want a date honey the top of the newspaper writhed in sudden flickering of dayfire print. phone 5828316 and i give you a real date. then the dayfire print was gone. i hope i can remember that number kitfox said anxiously. strange buffalo where is there a telephone exchange they are the same and single and right outside past the booths strange buffalo said. you were sitting upon it when i came upon you. and you you old strawhead you thought it was a bale of rags. kitfox went outside past the booths of the stonebuffalocoin makers and the claybadgercoin makers past the tents of the porcupinequill dealers to what he had thought was a bale of rags a lively bale of rags as he now remembered it. well it was an ample lady in her glad rags and she was the telephone exchange lying there in the grass. i want to call number 5828316 kitfox said uneasily. here are a handful of dice the gladrags lady told him. arrange them here in the short grass and make any number you want. but proper dice have numbers only to six kitfox protested and some of the numbers are higher. those are improper dice they are crooked dice the lady said. they have numbers more than six and numbers less than one. number out your telephone number in the short grass with them. are you sure this is the way to dial a number kitfox asked. sure im not sure the lady said. if you know a better way do it that way. worth a try kid worth a try. kitfox numbered out his numbers in the short grass. now what do i do he asked. oh talk into the telephone here. that buckskin bag is a telephone try it try it. drop a badger coin in and try it. kitfox dropped the coin into the telephone. hello hello he said. hello hello the lady answered. thats my number you called. you want a date i wait for you awhile. believe me i get pretty tired of waiting pretty soon. i dont think this is a telephone exchange at all kitfox grumbled. how else i can get guys so easy to drop badgercoins in a buckskin bag the lady said. come along lover man we will have a grand time this day. the lady was fullbodied and jolly. kitfox remembered her from somewhere. who are you he asked her. im your wife in the straw days she said but this is a grass day. theyre harder to find but theyre more fun when you find one. they have something to do with grandfathers brother and that wrestling of his. days of grass days of straw kitfox said as he embraced the lady passionately. how about a hay day you mean a heyday those are special. we hope to make them more often if only the wrestle is better. theyre fuller of juice than the grass days even. we try to make one now. they made a heyday together together with a whole nation of people and it went on and on. daytorch that was the lady in the glad rags the lady who was kitfoxs wife during the straw days bought an eaglewingbone whistle from a dealer and she whistled happy haunting tunes on it. the people followed kitfox and daytorch out of town out to the oceans of buffalo grass and bluestem grass. they torched everything that was dry and set the blueblack smoke to rolling. but the fundamental earth was too green to burn. all mounted horses and took lances. they went out after buffalo. word was brought to them that some of the newly armed buffalo bulls wanted to schedule battle with them. and the battle was a good one with gushing blood and brokenopen bodies and many on each side were killed. strange buffalo was killed. that big boisterous man died with a happy whoop. strange buffalo indeed one of the buffalo bulls said. he looks like a man to me. when the ground there had become too soggy and mired in blood they adjourned the battle till the next day of grass or the one after that. bloody battles are fine but who wants to spend a whole day on one there are other things. kitfox and daytorch and a number of other folks went to higher ground. there was a roaring river on the higher ground the biggest river ever and the loudest. oh be quiet daytorch said. youve got the tune wrong. the great river ceased to roar. daytorch whistled the right tune on the eaglewing bone whistle. then the river resumed its roaring but in this right tune now. this mightiest of all rivers was named cottonwood creek. henry drumhead added his beat to the tune. then the folks had a rain dance till the sharp rain came down and drenched them through. they had a sun dance then till the sun dried up the mud and began to burn the hides of the people. they had a cloud dance then. they had an antelope dance till enough antelope came to provide a slaughter and a feast. they had a pit dance a fire dance a snake dance and an ashes dance the ashes from pecan wood and hickory wood are a better condiment than salt to go with roast antelope. they had a feast dance. then after a while a shakedown dance. they had a thunder dance and a mountain dance. say it is spooky to come to the foot of the mountain itself and see the great gap between it and the ground rocks and boulders fell off of the bottom of the mountain and killed many of the people below. and from the mountain itself a broken bloody and headless torso fell down to the earth. helen hightowerah that is to say the gladrag lady daytorchset up a rakish screaming the head the head somebody forgot the head there was a thunderous grumbling a mountainshaking irritation but the bloody head did come down and smash itself like a bursting pumpkin on the earth. a lot of times they forget to throw the head down if you dont remind them daytorch said. the meaning of the fallen torso and head was that there was now one less prophet or wrestler on the mountain that there was now an opportunity for one more man to ascend to glory and death. several of the men attempted it by various devices by piling cairns of stones to climb upon by leaping into the air to try to grab one of the dangling roots of the mountain by hurling lances with trailing lianas to fasten quivering in the bottom of the mountain. they played it out in the garish day there where all the colors were so bright that they ached. many of the men fell to their deaths but one ascended. there is always one who is able to ascend to the great wrestle when there is an empty place to receive him. and the one who ascended wasno no youll not have his name from us yet. something was mighty odd here. there was just a little bit of something right about things. 2. draftsman draftsman what do you draw dog days draggy days days of straw. ballads henry drumhead 3. indian summer. a period of warm or mild weather late in autumn or in early winter. websters collegiate so websters collegiate defines it but websters hasnt the humility ever to admit that it doesnt know the meaning of a word or phrase. and it doesnt know the meaning of this one. there are intervals days hours minutes that are not remembered directly by anyone. they do not count in the totality of passing time. it is only by the most sophisticated methods that even the existence of these intervals may be shown. there are whole seasons in addition to the four regular seasons that are supposed to constitute the year. nobody knows where they fit in there being no room for them anywhere in the year nobody has direct memory of being in them or living in them. yet somehow they have names that have escaped these obliterations. the name of one of the misfit seasons is indian summer. why cant the indians have their summer in the summertime like the rest of us comes a high voice with a trace of annoyance. not a highpitched voice a high voice. but all that is neither here nor there. it is yonder and we will come to it. christopher foxx was walking down a city street. things were mighty even here mighty neat. there was just a little bit of something wrong about their rightness. the world was rubbed scrubbed and tubbed it was shaved paved and saved it was neat sweet and effete. ah the latter was possibly what was wrong with it if anything could be wrong with perfection. the colors were all flat flat colors had been deemed best for nerves and such and the sounds were all muted. christopher for a moment wished for a color that shrieked and for a sound that blazed. he put the thought resolutely out of his head. after all he had for wife helen hightower and he suffered much criticism because of her gaudiness and exuberance. christopher took a paper from the slot on the corner noted that it was a day in may he had a queer feeling that he had been uneasy about the date and yet all that registered with him was that it fell within a familiar month. he entered the north paragon breakfast club. it was there that the symposium would begin it would last the whole day and into the night and be held at various sites on the multiplex subject spatial and temporal underlays to the integrated world with insights as to their possible reality and their relationship to the world unconscious and to the therapeutic amnesia with consideration of the necessity of belief in stratified worlds and explorations of the orological motif in connection with the apparent occurrence of simultaneous days. it would have been an exciting subject if excitement had not become another of the muted things. buford strange was already at the north paragon and with him were adrian montaigne and vincent rue. i have already ordered for ourselves and for yourself christopher buford said. it is sheldrake and i hope that you like it. they will not prepare it for fewer than four persons. we cant go around killing quarter ducks they say. that is all right christopher said meekly. he glanced at the other three nervously. there was surely something familiar about them all. great blue mountain thunder why shouldnt there be he had worked  with these men daily for several years. but no no his edgy mind told him that they were familiar in some other and more subtle way. he glanced at the paper which he had taken from the corner slot outside. something like quick flame ran across the top of it and was gone too quickly to verify. but was it possible that the flame had said you want a date honey you phone of course it was not possible. clearly at the top of the paper it was printed a day in may. clearly was that clear enough for a date what date is this christopher asked the three of them. may the eighth of course adrian answered him. youve got todays journal in your hand and still you ask well now it was printed clearly there may 8 and there was no nonsense about a day in may still less was there anything like you want a date honey some wildlooking children burst into the north paragon breakfast club. strawmen strawmen they cried at the four gentlemen there. straw men strawmen the children buffeted the four men a bit did other extravagant things that are since forgotten and then they went out of the breakfast club again or at least they disappeared they were no longer there. why should they have done that adrian asked puzzled. why should they have called us that and done the other things why should who have called us what vincent asked even more puzzled. i dont know adrian said dryly. it seemed that someone was here and said or did something. youre witless adrian vincent chided. nobody was here. strawman christopher foxx said softly. i remember the word now and i couldnt remember it before. i woke up this morning trying to remember it. it seemed to be the key to a dream that was slipping away in spite of my trying to hang on to it. i have the key word now but it fits nothing. the dream is gone forever. we will come back to this subject later in our discussions buford strange said. i believe that your word strawman christopher is a part of the underlay or perhaps of the overlay that pertains to our world and our study. there is a good chance that certain children or perhaps dwarfs or gnomes entered here several moments ago. did any of you notice them no said vincent rue. no one entered said adrian montaigne. no. i didnt see anyone said christopher foxx. yet i believe that a group did come in buford strange continued suavely. it was a group unusual enough to be noticed. then why didnt we notice it or why did we forget within a short moment that we had seen it at all i believe it was because the group was in a different sort of day. i am nearly sure that it is a group that lives in either st. martins summer or in the kingfisher days. ah here is the sheldrake ready with all the trimmings drool and be happy. we shall never know such moment again. it was a momentous fowl no question of that. it was good it was rich it was overflowing with juice. it was peer of the fowl that are found in the land named st. succulentuss springtime. what what there is a land named that the four noble men they were ennobled by the circumstance fell to eating with what in days of another sort might almost be called gusto. it was a royal bird and was basted with that concoction of burst fruits and crushed nuts and peppers and ciders and holy oils and reindeer butter that is called wait a bit do you know that the sheldrake is really a mysterious creature buford strange asked as he ate noisily nobody eats such royal fare in quiet. buford acted as if he knew a secret. it is not a mysterious creature at all adrian countered he knew it was though. it is only the common european duck. it is not only the common european duck buford said strongly. in other days it may be quite uncommon. what are you saying buford vincent rue asked him. in what other days oh i believe possibly in what the dutch call kraanzomer crane summer. are we agreed that the other days the days out of count are topic rather than temporal we are not even agreed that there are days out of count christopher objected. drakes teeth by the way while rare are not unknown adrian montaigne popped the statement out of his mouth as if in someone elses voice. he seemed startled at his own words. drake is really the same word as drakos a dragon christopher foxx  mumbled. ah i was going to say something else but it is gone now. waiter what is the name of the excellent stuff with which the drake is basted and to which it is wedded vincent rue asked in happy wonder. dragons sauce said the waiter. well just what is the mystery the uncommonness of the sheldrake buford christopher asked him. i dont seem to remember that man said. ah let us start our discussion with my our failure to remember such things. vincent did you not have a short paper prepared on amnesia the holes in the pockets of the seamless garment i forget. did i have such a paper prepared i will look in my own pockets. meanwhile back on the mountain back on the thundering mountain there were certain daring and comic persons rushing in and out and counting coup on the wrath of god. it is a dangerous game. these were the big prophets who prayed so violently and sweated so bloodily and wrestled so strongly. it was they who fought for the salving or the salvation of the days in fear and in chuckling in scareshaking and in laughtershaking. the thundering mountain was a funny one this morning. it didnt reach clear to the ground. there was a great space between and there were eagles flying under it. and the day the day was it really the first monday of bluegoose autumn was it really a monday at all or was it a thursday or an aleikaday it was like another morning of not long before. the eagles remember it the clouds remember it the mountain wrestlers remember it dimly though some of the memory has been taken away from them. remember how it is written on the holy skins if you have faith you shall say to the mountain remove from here and cast thyself into the sea and it will do it. well on that morning they had tried it. several of the big prophets and wrestlers tried it for they did have faith. they groaned with travail and joy they strove mightily and they did move the mountain and make it cast itself into the sea. but the thunders made the waters back off. the waters refused to accept or to submerge the mountain. the prayermen and wrestlers had sufficient faith but the ocean did not. whoever had the last laugh on that holy morning the strivers were timeless of the prime age but they were often called the grandfathers brothers by the people. they were up there now the great prophets and prayermen and wrestlers. one of these intrepid men was an indian and he was attempting to put the indian sign on god himself. god however was like a mist and would not be signed. we will wrestle the indian said to god in the mist we will wrestle to see which of us shall be lord for this day. i tell you it is not thick enough if only the regular days flow. i hesitate to instruct you in your own business and yet someone must instruct you. there must be overflowing and special days apart from the regular days. you have such days i am sure of that but you keep them prisoned in a bag. it is necessary now that i wrest one of them from you. they wrestled inasmuch as a man slick with his own sweat and blood may wrestle with a mist and it seemed that the indian won the lordship of a day from god. it will be a day of grass the indian said. it will be none of your dry and juiceless days. the indian lay exhausted with his fingers entwined in the won day and the strength came back to him. you make a great thing about marking every sparrows fall the indian said then. see that you forget not to mark this day. the thing that happened then was this god marked the day for which they had wrestled but he marked it on a different holy skin in a different place not on the regular skin that lists the regular days. this act caused the wrested day to be one of the days out of count. prophets wrestlers prayingmen of other sorts were on the mountain also. there were black men who sometimes strove for kaffircorn days or ivory tree days. there were brown island men who wrestled for sailfish days or wildpig days. there were pinkish northwood men who walked on pine needles and balsam there were gnarled men out of the swampy lands there were town men from the great towns. all of these strove with the lord in fear and in chuckling. some of these were beheaded and quartered and the pieces of them were flung down violently to earth it is believed that there were certain qualities lacking in these or that their strength had finally come to an end. but the others the most of them won great days from the lord heydays halcyon or kingfisher days maedchensommer days st. garvais days indian summer days. these were all rich days full of joy and death bubbling with ecstasy and blood. and yet all were marked on different of the holy skins and so they became the days out of count.  ور days out of the count buford strange was saying its an entrancing idea and we have almost proved it. seasons out of the count its striking that the word for putting a condiment on should be the same word as a division of the year. well the seasons out of the count are all well seasoned and spiced. there are whole multiplex layered eras out of the count. the ice ages are such. i do not say were suchʼ i say are such. but the ice ages are real real real helen hightower insisted. quite a few long hours had passed in the discussions and now helen hightower the wife of christopher foxx was off her work at the telephone exchange and had put on her glad rags and joined the scholars. certainly they are real helen buford strange said. if only i were so real i believe that you remember them or know them more than most of us do. you have a dangerously incomplete amnesia on so many things that i wonder the thunder doesnt come and take you. but in the days and years and centuries and eras of the straight count there are no ice ages. well then how for instance would local dwellers account for terminal moraines and glacial till generally asked conquering sharpleafah vincent rue. they were at the university in that cozy room in the psychology department where buford strange usually held forth the room that was just below the special effects room of professor timacheff. how did they account for such before the time of modern geology buford asked. they didnt. there would be a new boulder one morning that had not been there the day before. the sheepherder of the place would say that the moon had drawn it out of the ground or that it had fallen from the sky. youre crazy buford adrian montaigne said with a certain affection.  why the ice ages then why should they have happened even in times out of count why should they have left their footprints in the times within the count adrian had very huge and powerful hands. why had they not noticed this before i believe there was a dynasty of great and muscular prophets and ghost wrestlers who wanted to call out the terrible days of fimbul winter buford said in a hushed voice. i dont know why they wanted such things or why they sweated blood and wrestled prodigies to obtain them. they were men but they are remembered as the frost giants. oh my grand grand uncles daytorchhelen hightower rather cried out. days of snow days of ice millions of them you are saying that certain archetypes kitfox began. shook the pillars of heaven till the snow and ice fell down for a million days for a million days out of the count buford strange finished. strange buffalo ah buford you are crazy christopher foxx chided much as adrian had. christopher was talking but the queerly smiling adrian had now become the presence in the room. adrian had the curious under rutile of the skin of one who has sweated blood in prayer and buffoonery and passion. why had they not noticed that of him before i could almost believe that you were one of the great challengers yourself strange christopher said to buford but he was looking at adrian. you strike me as with a lance kit buford said sadly. you uncover my mortification. for i failed. i dont know when it was. it was on a day out of the count. i failed a year ago or ten thousand years ago. i could not make it among the great ones. i was not cast out to my death i was never in. there was room for me and an opportunity for the ascent but i failed in nerve. and one who has aspired to be a champion or prophet cannot fall back to be an ordinary man. so i am less than that i am short of manhood. but sadly i do remember and live in other sorts of days. i believe that the aberrant days are simultaneous with the prosaic days adrian montaigne mused. adrian was quite a large man. why had they not noticed that before no no they are not simultaneous buford was correcting him. there are the days out of the count and there are the days in the count. those out of count are outside of time so they cannot be simultaneous with anything. you have to see it that way. you see it your way and ill see it mine. adrian was stubborn. consider some of the aberrant times or countries st. garvais springtime st. martins summer the saints in these names were mountain prophets and wrestlers but some of them were not at all saintly in their violence midas march the very rich need their special season also it is said that in their special month they are superiorly endowed in all ways dog days halcyon days dragon days harvest may what in the world is harvested in may allhallow summer days of ivory days of horn indian summer wicklow week apricot autumn goose summer giantstone days day of the crooked mile the season called alcedonia by the latins. i tell you that all these days are happening at the same time this man named adoration on the mountain or rather adrian montaigne had a reckless sort of transcendence about him now. no they do not all happen at the same time strange buffalo was saying for the aberrant days of them are not in time. they are places and not times. are there no nighttime hours in the times out of time vincent rue asked. no. not in the same sense. they are in another province entirely buford said. there was thunder in the special effects room of professor timacheff on the floor just above them cheerful almost vulgar thunder. timacheff taught some sensational sense response and also melodramatic courses up there. but how did he get such special effects anyhow they do happen at the same time adrian mountain insisted and he was laughing like boulders coming together. quite a few things seemed to be happening to adrian all at the same time. they are all happening right now. i am sitting with you here this minute but i am also on the mountain this minute. the thunder in the room above it is real thunder you know. and there is a deeper more distant more raffish thunder behind it which primitives call godslaughter thunder. this gets out of hand now vincent rue protested. it is supposed to be a serious symposium on spatial and temporal underlays. several of you have turned it into a silly place and a silly time. you are taking too anthropomorphic a view of all these things including god. one does not really wrestle with god in a bush or a mist or ride in wildly on a pony and count coup on god. even as an atheist i find these ideas distasteful. but we are anthropoi men adrian proclaimed. what other view than an anthropomorphic view could we take that we should play the godgame that we should wrestle with a godform and try to wrest lordship of days from him that we should essay to count coup on god i as a theist do not find at all distasteful. why one of them is failing now it happens so seldom. i wonder if i have a chance. adrian what are you talking about vincent demanded. how could you do it adrian when i could not buford strange asked. remember me when you come to your place adrian daytorch cried. send me a day. oh send me a dayfire day. and me also adrian kitfox begged. i would love to do it myself but it isnt given to everyone. there was a strong shouting in the room above. there was the concussion of bodies and the roaring of mountain winds. what in all the crooked days is professor timacheff doing up there this evening vincent sharpleaf asked angrily. and what things are you doing here adrian you look like a man set afire. make room for me oh make room for me adrian of the mountain cried out in a voice that had its own crackling thunder. he was in the very transport of passion and he glistened red with his own bloody sweat. one is failing one is falling why doesnt he fall then help with it kitfox and i help also daytorch yowled. i help kitfox yelped. the room shuddered the building shuddered the whole afternoon shuddered. there was a rending of boulders either on the prophets mountain or in the special effects room of professor timacheff above them. there was a great breaking and entering a place turning into a time. there came a roaring like horses in the sky. then was the multiplex crash god save his soul his body is done for of bloody torso and severed limbs falling into the room from a great height splintering the table at which the five of them sat breaking the room splattering them all with blood. but the ceiling above was unbreached and unharmed and there was no point of entry. i am not man enough even to watch it buford strange gurgled and he slumped sideways unconscious. timacheff you fool vincent rue bawled to the space above them. watch your damned special effects youre wrecking the place unquestionably that timacheff was good. he used his special effects in classes on phenomenology that he taught up there. the head the head dont let them forget the head daytorch cried in a flaming voice. i just remembered that timacheff is out of town and is holding no classes today kitfox muttered in vulpine wonder. make room for me oh make room for me adrian mountain boomed. then he was gone from the midst of them. he would be a factor though in days to come. the head the head daytorch flamed and scorched. christopher and vincent tried to straighten up the unconscious buford strange. they shook him but he came apart and one arm came off him. he was revealed as a strawman filled with bloody straw and no more. why hes naught but a poorly made scarecrow christopher foxx said in wonder. he was right that one who falls back from it cannot become an ordinary man again. he will be less than man. thats funny. he always looked like a man to me vincent rue said. the head the head you forget the head. let the head fall down day torch cried. and the head fell down. it smashed itself like a bursting pumpkin on the broken floor. 4. under the town is a woolier town and the blood splashed up and the head fell down. ballads henry drumhead r. a. lafferty began selling fiction regularly in the early 1960s and went fulltime as a writer in 1971. his novels include past master 1968 fourth mansions 1969
